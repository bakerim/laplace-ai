Fox News co-hosts Greg Gutfeld and Gillian Turner got into an argument during Friday night’s episode of The Five over the FIFA Peace Prize awarded to President Donald Trump in a ceremony earlier in the day. While discussing the prize, which was awarded to Trump by FIFA President Gianni Infantino in a ceremony at the Kennedy Center, Gutfeld said, “I also love that the peace prize from FIFA, it didn’t go to like Greta Thunberg or some silly little peace activist.” This prompted Turner to reply, “B",[]

Countdowns are flying off the shelves, so snag your 2025 Advent calendar before it's too late. Trust me, I'm speaking from experience here. (Photo Illustration: Amanda Garrity/Yahoo News; Voluspa)

I'm not here to get your tinsel in a tangle, but seasoned merrymakers know it’s already too late to nab some of this year’s hottest Advent calendars. So consider this your last call! The good news: There are still some great options left — and many last-minute Advent calendars are on sale for Black Friday. In other words, there’s no time like the present to make your pick. I got my hands on this year’s newest releases and opened every single door — hundreds, in fact! — to bring you the best Advent calendars of 2025.



There are plenty of familiar favorites from the likes of Lego and Godiva, but the 2025 holiday season also brings some new Advent calendars for men and women, from a Hallmark Channel-inspired wine countdown to limited-edition beauty Advent calendars that offer impressive value (I'm talking $800-plus worth of makeup and skincare for $150). Not sure how you want to bring the cheer? You can't go wrong with countdowns filled with cheery chocolates, coffee pods, festive candles or mini bottles of wine. Or better yet, spring for a reusable calendar and stick whatever you want inside.



Some of this year's most popular Advent calendars — ahem, Bonne Maman and Anthropologie — are already sold out, and I'm sure everything else on this list will soon follow suit. My two cents: Make your pick now and yule rest easy from now until December 1.

Trending Christmas gifts

Amazon Body Restore Shower Steamers, 6-Pack Who it's for: Someone who needs some self-care Why I picked it: Sometimes, the only time she has for a little self-care is in the shower, so help her make the most of it with these heavenly smelling shower steamers. Made with baking soda and essential oils, these scented melts turn the daily wash into a spa-like experience. Each scent targets something specific: Lavender and Chamomile bring relaxation, Citrus Grove is a mood-booster, Eucalyptus Mint is a refreshing wake-up and so on. The steamers come in a pack of six, and each one lasts for at least one shower. ""A small luxury that makes a thoughtful gift,"" said this caring Amazon shopper. ""This set is my go-to gift for new moms; it's a simple way to pamper them at home without needing a spa day. I've given these to friends and my sisters after they've had babies, and they've all loved having a little something just for them."" $14 at Amazon

Amazon Our Place Always Pan 2.0 Who it's for: The at-home cook who needs a helping hand Why I picked it: Oprah called this 10-in-1 essential ""the kitchen magician,"" and it's been dominating Google searches ever since. But really, it's the minimalist design and versatility that has made Our Place the top-searched brand of cookware in 2025 — yep, it made Google's Holiday 100 list. Senior Home Writer Lisa Schweitzer put the latest version of the brand's bestseller to the test and confirmed that it's a multitasker's dream. ""I had no trouble releasing eggs and searing chicken. The steamer basket that doubles as a colander is a huge help,"" she raved. Nab it while it's under $100 for a limited time. $99 at Amazon

Amazon Body Restore Heated Eye Masks, 5 Pack Who it's for: Someone who needs 30 minutes of R&R Why I picked it: Hot compresses soothe dry, tired eyes. How exactly? Well, they boost oil production, relieving sensitivity and that all-too-familiar sting. Get these scented eye masks at a record-low price and bring comfort in minutes — they slowly (but surely) heat up when exposed to air and stay warm for up to 30 minutes. My advice: Stash them in your bag for on-the-go relief, but keep a few in your nightstand for when you need a little help winding down after a long day. $10 at Amazon

Amazon Etsfmoa Unisex Beanie with Light Who it's for: Adults who plan to keep on keepin' on during the depths of winter Why I picked it: This beanie really lit up the charts last holiday season. It was a No. 1 Amazon bestseller all winter long and one of the most popular picks in last year's gift guides. I have a feeling it won't be going anywhere anytime soon, so I'd snag it for the hard-to-shop-for person in your life who, ya know, needs to light their way when they walk the dog, take out the trash or tackle some chores after work. They'll get eight hours of light on a single charge; then they can power it up with a basic USB charger before their next after-hours adventure. $10 at Amazon

Amazon Crock-Pot Electric Lunch Box Who it's for: Teachers, truckers and more on-the-go eaters Why I picked it: Think of this No. 1 bestseller as a mini slow cooker (20 ounces, to be exact) that anyone can take with them to keep food warm all day long. Plug it in about 45 minutes before mealtime for a piping hot nosh. ""As a teacher, this has got to be the most genius item that I have ever been gifted/gifted to others,"" one teacher raved. ""This item warms up not just soup, but smaller meals, in 30 minutes or less. I had a coworker who even plugged it in for up to 3-4 hours, and she stated that it did not burn her food. I would recommend to anyone who does not have a lot of time for lunch."" $40 at Amazon

Amazon Marycele Candle Warmer Lamp Who it's for: Homebodies looking to bring the cozy Why I picked it: Lighting candles isn't for the faint of heart — there's the soot, smoke and, well, ever-present fear of forgetting to blow the flame out. Enter candle warmer lamps, which slowly melt the wax from the top down and release an aroma without a single flame. Crank it up to the highest brightness level for the strongest scent or dim the light for a subtle waft, then set a timer from two to eight hours to better control the glow. $23 at Amazon

Amazon Bedsure Heated Blanket Throw Blanket Who it's for: The person in your life who's always cold Why I picked it: We are headed toward the coldest time of the year! One of the best remedies for cold and gloomy nights is snuggling up with a warm blanket. While any old throw blanket will keep you warm, heated blankets are a must-have for those truly bone-chilling days or when you're too lazy to put on another layer of clothing. This pick — now at its lowest price in months — features a supersoft fleece material that is great without the heating, but even cozier with it. $46 at Amazon

Best Christmas gifts for men

Amazon LifeStraw Personal Water Filter Who it's for: The ones who are always on the go Why I picked it: Even the most daring types need to keep their health and safety top of mind when they're on the trails.

""Not only am I secretly giving my loved ones a survival tool, but they all think it’s totally cool when they get it!"" $16 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $20 at Ace Hardware

Amazon Shanker Golf Frustrated Golfer Socks Who it's for: Golfers with a good sense of humor Why I picked it: These silly socks are for the guy who's on par for greatness, but his golf skills aren't PGA-worthy just yet. Alright, I'm not saying they paint an all-too-familiar picture of your golfer on the green, but I'm also not saying that they don't. Stuff 'em in his stocking for an easy laugh or include them in a bundle with a bunch of actually useful golf gifts for something a bit more well-rounded. $10 at Amazon

Amazon Rak Magnetic Wristband Who it's for: Do-it-yourselfers who are big on efficiency Why I picked it: Here's an affordable way for your handy helper to get a whole lot, well, handier.

Wonderbly Wonderbly Your Life In Headlines Book Who it's for: Hard-to-shop-for history buffs Why I picked it: You can customize just about any gift, but only a few personalized presents are actually worthwhile. This is one of those nice-to-haves that he'll happily flip through and leave out on his coffee for all to see (which, let's face it, is a major win). All you have to do is submit his name and birthday (down to the year), then they'll fill the pages with all the major newspaper headlines from over the decades. He's sure to recognize a few (like if he happened to be born on the day of the moon landing), but others will be a welcome surprise. $90 at Wonderbly

Amazon MoCuishle Shiatsu Back Shoulder and Neck Massager Who it's for: Do-it-all dads in need of some self-care Why I picked it: While, yes, you could always attempt (key word: attempt) to give him a shoulder rub, this electric massager will be more effective in working out his knots and kinks. Drape it over the shoulders or position it somewhere along the waist, then switch between three different speeds. ""This deep-tissue massage hurts and heals in equal measure,"" one relaxed reviewer wrote. $20 at Amazon

Best Christmas gifts for women

From boiling and braising to roasting and baking, this kitchen workhorse does it all — and looks incredibly good while doing it. It can be used on just about any type of stovetop, and it's oven-safe up to 500°F. $60 at Amazon

Amazon Aveeno Skin Relief Repairing Hand Masks, 4-Pack Who it's for: The woman itching for some quality R&R Why I picked it: Because her skin care routine shouldn't start and stop at her face. Simply slip on the shea butter-infused gloves and rub in any visible product after the 10 minutes is up to reveal smoother, softer hands. ""This is a godsend for my hands. I wish they had one body-sized,"" one soft-skinned shopper wrote. A tip: Snag each mask for under $4 a pop in this four-pack and divvy them up between stockings! $15 at Amazon

BAGSMART BAGSMART Travel Toiletry Bag Who it's for: Travelers who want to pack smarter, not harder Why I picked it: Frequent fliers love this lightweight, water-resistant toiletry bag, which has all the bells and whistles, including a front zipper pocket for easy access, side pouches with elastics to secure makeup brushes and compartments galore. And while it's on the larger side, it's sized to fit comfortably in a 24-inch suitcase (or, ya know, you can always carry it on its own).

One swift shopper (and fellow mama) pointed out that she uses it beyond her travels. ""I use my Luka duffel as a bag for my breast pump supplies when I go to work.

Amazon Kendra Scott Mini Elisa Pendant Necklace Who it's for: The woman who wants to open a little yellow box on Christmas morning Why I picked it: Trust me, a little sparkle goes a long way — and this piece is proof.

Crate & Barrel KitchenAid Artisan Porcelain 5-Quart Tilt-Head Stand Mixer with Walnut Bowl Who it's for: Bakers and cooks who say the kitchen is their happy place Why I picked it: I know, I know, this stand mixer costs a pretty penny, but it is hands-down one of the most useful Christmas gifts you can give. It's more than a statement piece; it's a culinary rite of passage that'll help even the most novice home chefs whip up homemade breads, pastas, sweet treats and just about anything else that needs a good mixin' for years to come. Last year, the brand dropped its first-ever stand mixer with a wooden bowl — and this porcelain number is all-new for the 2025 holiday season. $600 at Crate & Barrel

Amazon Skillmatics 'Lilo & Stitch' Poke-in Art Who it's for: School-age kids obsessed with Stitch Why I picked it: More than 20 years after the release of Disney's Lilo & Stitch, the fuzzy blue alien is still capturing hearts. This little guy has become even more popular in the last year due to the movie's live-action remake, and there are tons of new toys and games to show for it. This craft kit is one of the coolest releases I've seen — kids ages 4 and up can poke fabric squares through the holes of foam characters, then put the colorful creations on display. Kids will work on their fine motor skills; parents will breathe a sigh of relief since it's basically mess-free. Not sure whether Stitch is totally their speed? There are tons of kits to choose from — princesses, flower bouquets, underwater animals and more. $30 at Amazon

Amazon Squishmallows Jonessa The Purple Psychedelic Tie-Dye Bear Who it's for: Squishmallows fans who always want the latest and greatest Why I picked it: Alright, I know their Squishmallows collection is probably out of control by now, but how can you pass up an all-new release? This adorable tie-dye bear is dropping just in time for the holidays, so there's a good chance your kid won't even know about it. Pre-order it ASAP to guarantee on-time arrival, then rest easy knowing you're winning Christmas this year. $16 at Amazon

Best Christmas gifts for tweens and teens

Amazon Sol de Janeiro Bum Bum Jet Set Who it's for: Tweens, teens or anyone else who likes keeping up with the trends Why I picked it: Ask any teen and they'll tell you that Sol de Janeiro makes their favorite scents. Cheirosa 62 is the brand's biggest seller — it's sweet, nutty and as warm as the Brazilian sunshine that inspired it. Instead of wrapping up a single tub (it's a whopping $48), opt for this trio, which also includes travel-friendly versions of the perfume mist and body wash in the same scent. $34 at Amazon

Amazon Muid Benson Lying Flat Duck Night Light Who it's for: The too-cool-for-school teen who is still just a kid Why I picked it: When in doubt, go with a gift that'll really quack them up. Give this light-up duck a pat on the back to adjust between three brightness levels or set a 30-minute timer. I get it: They're too big for a nightlight (or so they claim), but who can resist a bedside companion as cute as this little guy? $19 at Amazon

Revolve Starface Big Lil' Gift Set Who it's for: The ones who accessorize with pimple patches Why I picked it: Giving acne products as gifts is usually a hard no for me, but pimple patches are now seen as a badge of honor for the younger generations. Inside this fuzzy, limited-edition case, they'll find a lip balm and 32 star-shaped patches that are just as cute as they are effective. The clear ones are best for surface-level pimples, but the blue stars tackle deeper clogged pores and, ya know, make a splashier statement. $20 at Revolve

Amazon Flip 7 Card Game Who it's for: Gamers who are looking for something new Why I picked it: Card games are cooler than ever right now. UNO and Monopoly Deal are the heavy-hitters, but let me introduce you to the newest kid on the block: Flip 7, a fast-paced game where you try to reach 200 points without getting any duplicate cards. It's all about the luck of the draw — sure, there's strategy involved, but it's really a test of how badly you want to press your luck. More than 10,000 Amazon shoppers picked up a deck in the last month alone, and I bet that number will go up by the time the holidays roll 'round. $8 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $8 at Target$10 at CVS Pharmacy

Amazon Shashibo Shape Shifting Box Who it's for: Puzzlers who don't like being put in a box Why I picked it: I'm not a fan of one-and-done toys. Ya know, the ones that they play with for minutes and then spend years collecting dust in a closet somewhere. This geometric wonder can transform into a star, triangle or one of 70-plus other shapes, so it'll take 'em quite some time to see all that it has to offer. ""The fact that it is also magnetized is really neat as it allows some of the odd combinations to actually stick together and form free-standing structures,"" one proud puzzler penned. $22 at Amazon

Yeah, yeah — I know white elephant exchanges aren’t really supposed to be about the gifts. But as Yahoo’s resident gift expert, my eyes go straight to that present pile anyway. And let me tell you: I’ve walked away with more than a few duds over the years. Sure, the stealing and swapping is half the fun, but I also want to leave with something worth a little friendly chaos. These picks? They’re the rare gifts people will actually fight for — in the best way.



From funny gags to more useful buys, these white elephant gifts cover all the bases (for under $50, I might add!). Hoping to bring the laughs? Snacking chopsticks will do just that. What about a practical pick for people that you don't know as well? Stick with tried-and-true favorites, from a bestselling battery organizer that's a recent Yahoo Best Gift Ever Awards winner to a dimmable duck lamp (the top-seller from last year's white elephant gift guide!). These are just some of the highlights — I've also included a bunch of gift ideas for kids, tweens and teens, since they deserve to get in on the fun too.



Have more parties on the books this holiday season? Then head on over to our ultimate Christmas gift guide and our Secret Santa gift list to check everyone else off your list while you're in the shopping spirit.

Best white elephant gifts overall

Amazon HappyBag LED Lying Flat Duck Light I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't give this little guy a mention. Last year, thousands of Yahoo readers picked up light-up duck and, well, I'm sure it got everyone at the party in the stealing spirit. Simply give the duck a gentle pat on the back to make it glow, then adjust the brightness level to one of three settings and set up the optional 30-minute timer. ""I love that it’s USB-charged, so no fumbling with batteries and a full charge lasts all night — enough for midnight journeys to the bathroom (or snack raids),"" one happy Amazon shopper quacked. $14 at Amazon

Sakura Box Japanese Snacks and Candy Dagashi Box Because food is the way to the heart, isn't it? Replenish their snack stash with 20 pieces of Japanese dagashi, everything from cookies and gummy candy to salty, savory bites. All bets are off on whether they'll share with the other party-goers, but for your sake, I hope they do! $25 at Amazon

Amazon Godonlif Candle Warmer Lamp Lighting candles isn't for the faint of heart. There's the soot, smoke, overwhelming fear that you forget to blow it out and the ever-present risk of fire. Candle warmer lamps are a smarter bet: They slowly melt the wax from the top down and release an aroma without a single flame. The brighter the light, the stronger the fragrance — switch between four brightness levels and set a timer to turn it off automatically. ""I love that this lamp has an adjustable height to work with any size candle and that it helps my candles last longer than traditional burning,"" one fired-up Amazon shopper raved about this bestseller with almost 5,000 reviews and an average 4.6-star rating. $21 at Amazon

Funniest white elephant gifts

Uncommon Goods Unlock the Wine Escape Room Game No one would willingly give up a good bottle of wine, but wouldn't you like to see how badly they want it? Stick your go-to red, white or rosé in the cage, then they'll have to solve escape room-style puzzles and riddles to crack the code. ""It is not easy to solve, but the challenge is worth it,"" one Uncommon Goods reviewer wrote. See? Where there's a wine, there's a way. $30 at Uncommon Goods

SeaRoomy SeaRoomy Burritos Tortilla Blanket If you’re aiming for the gift everyone will fight over, this burrito blanket is it. With over 6,000 five-star Amazon reviews, this ultra-soft throw wraps you up like a giant tortilla — equal parts cozy and hilarious. It’s big, warm, machine-washable and guaranteed to spark at least one “I’m a snack” photo op. $13 at Amazon

Amazon Charmin Forever Roll Starter Kit A gag gift that's still incredibly useful? Now, we're talkin'. This isn't your average TP; nope, this supersized roll has over 5,000 sheets and can last up to a month (not exactly forever like the name implies, but still). Spring for the starter set, so they'll get double the paper and a holder that's actually designed to handle rolls of this size. $35 at Amazon

Amazon Snactiv Pro Snack Chopsticks A little bit of flavor dust doesn't hurt, but it can certainly get in the way if you're trying to do literally anything else while you get your snack on. Enter my most random (but useful) Shark Tank discovery yet: finger chopsticks, which let you grip chips, cheese puffs or your munchies of choice without dirtying up your hands. Can you snack without it? Obviously. But should you settle for greasy controllers or a crumb-filled keyboard? Nope, and that's why it's a great white elephant gift in my eyes! $18 at Amazon

Most useful white elephant gifts

Amazon Nodpod Gentle Pressure Sleep Mask A good night's sleep is hands-down the best gift you can give, and this weighted eye mask may be just the thing they need to snooze soundly. It blocks out light while applying gentle pressure across the head, hence why the brand describes it as a ""weighted blanket for your eyes."" Thousands of well-rested Amazon reviewers gush that it's changed their sleep game, including a night-shift nurse who called it a ""marvelous little invention"" and said it ""stays put even if you're a side sleeper."" $27 at Ulta

orastone Orastone Rechargeable Hand Warmer This rechargeable hand warmer has racked up more than 6,000 Amazon reviews and a 4.6-star rating — and shoppers rave about how quickly it heats up, how toasty it gets and, yes, how cute it is. It reaches over 100 degrees in under two minutes, fits comfortably in your palm and comes in fun patterns with a handy wrist strap. $24 at Amazon

Amazon Ontel Battery Daddy Storage System This may not seem like the most exciting white elephant gift out there, but here's where I beg to differ: This beloved bestseller is one of those things that most people don't have, but would actually benefit from. Sure, the lucky recipient may have a system (or say they say) to find the battery they're looking for, but this organizer will divide them up by size and type to make the search a whole lot easier. It even has a built-in tester to ensure that they're only keeping the ones that still have some life left in 'em. $17 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $20 at Target$17 at Ace Hardware

Amazon Ototo Splatypus Jar Spatula Because nobody should let precious peanut butter go to waste. This jar scraper is basically a silicone spatula disguised as a platypus (naturally), but it has a longer handle and sturdier (yet flexible) base designed to easily scrape the sides of any jar or container. Use it to clear out the nooks and crannies in all kinds of things — jarred sauces, jams, yogurt containers, the possibilities are infinite. $10 at Amazon

Amazon Glocusent Bendable Neck Light Yes, late-night reading types can wrap this hands-free gadget around their neck to light up the pages, but that's really just scratching the surface here. Thousands of Amazon shoppers (including yours truly!) reach for it when they're crafting, tinkering or even tending to some household chores after the sun goes down. Tailor it to the task at hand — choose between six brightness levels and three colors until the light's just right. More than 10,000 Amazon shoppers picked it up last month, with one writing that they originally bought it ""so I could crochet at night when my husband wanted the room dark for TV"" but found it especially useful to ""have on hand in case there's a storm when you lose electricity."" $16 at Amazon

Best white elephant gifts for kids and teens

Amazon Rubik’s Phantom Cube There's more than meets the eye here. The black tiles will change color with the heat of touch, presenting the puzzler with quite the challenge: solving the cube before the whole thing fades back to black. Part gag gift, part brain-bender, this cube is a true challenge for serious cubers — but a fun one at that! $9 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $9 at Target$20 at Ace Hardware

Amazon Schylling NeeDoh Ramen Noodlies Let them squish, twist and toss these sensory strings, er, noodles to their heart's content. Throw them into a sensory bin to really get their juices flowing, or play with them as-is. Both are equally as fun. ""This was a fun toy for my kids to fling around and pretend to be hair or whatever else their little hearts desire,"" one happy parent wrote on Amazon, adding that it's a plus that noodles are attached so they're ""not all loose inside the package."" $7 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $7 at Walmart

Amazon The Woobles Learn to Crochet Kit Grandma's hobbies are cooler than ever. Case in point: Google searches for these beginner-friendly crochet kits shot up 95% this year. Pierre the Penguin is the brand's hottest seller — this kit comes with everything you need to stitch the waddliest Wooble in the bunch, including step-by-step video tutorials, an ergonomic crochet hook, pre-started yarn and stuffing There's a good chance they'll get hooked (get it?), so tell the recipient they can always give Pierre a few friends (ahem, Walter the Bear and Felix the Fox). $30 at Amazon

Amazon Flip 7 Card Game Card games are always a white elephant winner, but I'd steer clear of the classics since there's a good chance the recipient already has them. My suggestion: Go with the deck that's currently dominating the Amazon charts. Meet Flip 7, a fast-paced game where you try to reach 200 points without getting any duplicate cards. Sure, there's plenty of strategy involved, but it's really a test of how much you're willing to push your luck. $8 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $8 at Target$10 at CVS Pharmacy

No need to stress — these universally loved picks work for just about anyone. (Photo Illustration: Amanda Garrity/Yahoo; Getty)

You pulled their name — now what? Picking a Secret Santa gift sounds easy, but it gets tricky fast when you barely know the person you drew. Sure, you could hand over a one-size-fits-all Christmas present, like a gift card or some cash, but you can definitely do better. Start here instead: a curated list of Secret Santa gift ideas that work for just about anyone.



There's one condition, though: If they gave you a wishlist to work with, then I'd rather you buy them what they actually want. But if you've been left in the dark, then take it from a gifting pro — these Secret Santa gifts are solid contenders. There are good-smelling shower steamers that are a perennial Yahoo reader favorite, a lucky Lego set and and an Owala tumbler that'll keep their coffee hot for hours. That's just scratching the surface — I've also included lots of Christmas gifts for men and Christmas presents for women at great prices (all under $35!).

How to play Secret Santa

Participants write their names down on a piece of paper and place them in a hat. Or, if you're going digital, consider using a Secret Santa generator like Elfster. One by one, participants draw a name to find out who they'll be shopping for. All players buy a gift for the person they picked, trying their best to keep their identity a secret. During the gift exchange, participants guess who their Secret Santa is.

Best Secret Santa gifts overall

Amazon Body Restore Shower Steamers, 6 Pack People love shower steamers. I'm not kidding, we've sold thousands of 'em in Yahoo gift guides over the last few years. They're basically TLC in tab form — just drop one in the corner of the shower, then breathe in the good-for-the-soul aromas as it slowly melts. Each scent targets a specific need: Lavender and Chamomile bring relaxation, Citrus Grove is a mood booster, Eucalyptus Mint is a welcome wake-up, and so on. $14 at Amazon

Amazon Godonlif Candle Warmer Lamp Candle warmers are one of the most novel inventions in the last decade or so. Place any candle underneath this little lamp, then crank on the light, set a timer (anywhere from two to 10 hours) and breathe in the aroma as the wax slowly melts. No flames, soot or smoke whatsoever! ""The candle smells just as good as when you light it and lasts even longer,"" one fired-up Amazon fan wrote. ""I have used candles I thought were done and they smell brand-new under the light."" $21 at Amazon

Uncommon Goods Greatest Chocolates of the World Exploratory Set Take their tastebuds on a trip around the world, one chocolate at a time.

Homesick Homesick Luke's Diner Candle Ask any Gilmore Girls fan, and they'll tell you that Luke's Diner is basically a main character in the show. She can light this candle and make her house smell just like the Stars Hollow institution — I'm talking freshly brewed coffee, syrupy-sweet pancakes and plenty of small-town charm. It has a 60 to 80-hour burn time, which, ya know, will carry her through the first few seasons she's re-watching. $35 at Homesick

Best Secret Santa gifts for men

Amazon The Master Theorem: A Book of Puzzles, Intrigue and Wit He's got his Wordle strategy on lock, so why don't you see if he's up for a new challenge? These aren't your average crosswords; nope, this book is full of 40-plus escape room-style puzzles that'll have him cracking cryptic codes and tackling tough brain-benders. ""They make you think,"" one escape-room enthusiast wrote on Amazon. ""I had to come back to one the next day because I was racking my brain. Not so obscure, but hard enough to be a challenge."" $30 at Amazon

Amazon Ontel Battery Daddy Storage System Ah, batteries — he's got a drawer full of 'em, so you might as well help him make sense of his stash. This storage case can hold 150 batteries in total, but the built-in battery tester will encourage him to only keep the ones that are in full working order. ""Now I can actually prove the batteries are dead instead of just yelling 'try another one.' Organization, domination and a weird sense of adult joy — 10/10 would recommend,"" one charged-up Amazon customer chimed. (Psst, I'm also a huge fan, which is why I recently included it in our Best Gift Ever Awards.) $17 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $20 at Target$17 at Ace Hardware

Dress for the job you want, right? $29 at Mark & Graham

No need to fret because I've got you covered with this list of the best gifts for men — yep, even the ones who are impossible to shop for.



As Yahoo's Gifting Editor, it's literally my job to track down the right gift for the ones you love.

Regardless of what they're into — whether it be traveling, fashion, beauty or spoiling their furry friend — there's something you can snag for just about any loved one. Plus, they'll enjoy the shopping experience of getting to select their own gift. Sounds like a sweet deal to us.

And while she probably isn't looking for all the pomp and circumstance for simply doing the job, she raised you right, which means you won't let anyone's hard work go unnoticed — especially hers. Enter this list of the best gifts for Mom for any (and every) occasion.



Sure, I've been showering my mom with presents for 30+ years, but as a true girl's girl and pro gift-giver, I'm always on the hunt for ways to spoil the ladies I love — grandmothers, aunts, sisters (and best friends who are like sisters), mothers-in-law, the list goes on. Here's the thing: Moms always have the answers, so I turned to moms in my life — including mine — to guide me as I hand-picked this selection of top-tier gifts for her. I’ve tried some of these picks firsthand, and others came highly recommended by some of my favorite women.



In search of a last-minute birthday gift for her? This pop-up paper bouquet doubles as a card, giving you plenty of space to write a sweet message inside. Or do you have your sights set on a big-ticket buy for Christmas? Treat her to this top-selling towel warmer. From small, inexpensive add-ons to worth-it splurges and subscriptions, you're bound to find the perfect gift for Mom that'll bring the happy tears.

In this guide gift ideas are broken up into the following categories: Most popular gifts for Mom | Unique gifts for Mom | Personalized gifts for Mom | Self-care and pampering gifts for Mom | Beauty and fashion gifts for Mom | Subscriptions and gift experiences for Mom

Amazon Body Restore Shower Steamers, 15 pack A spa day might not be in the cards this year, but these aromatherapy steamers will do the trick in the meantime. When she needs a luxurious breather, she can place one on the shower floor and breathe in its calming lavender scent. $25 at Amazon

Amazon Freshcut Paper Pop Up Bouquet A mother's love is forever — just like these sunshiney stems. This paper bouquet is as eye-catching as the real thing, but it'll actually stand the test of time. Write a heartfelt message in the accompanying card, and you've got yourself a great gift for under $15. $10 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $13 at Target

Amazon Farmer's Defense Sleeves These sleeves will protect her arms from sun, scratches and bug bites while she’s tending to her garden. “The sleeves are easy to pull on, and the bands on the upper arm that secure them is fitted perfectly,” one happy customer wrote, while noting that gardening gloves are still necessary “because part of your hands are still exposed.” Related: The best gifts for gardeners $30 at Amazon

Well, this fill-in-the-blank book is packed with prompts to help guide you. ""They allow you to easily recall memories and thoughts about your mother that you may have even forgotten! It’s a wonderful trip down memory lane,"" one sentimental shopper gushed. $14 at Amazon

Amazon Generic Vintage Glass Coffee Mugs, Set of 4 with Spoons These vintage-style glass mugs look like something you’d find in an antiques shop, but you can score them on Amazon — with two-day shipping, no less. They’re not just pretty, either: “I dropped one from a good height (above the countertop) and even though it hit my linoleum floor, it didn’t break, chip or crack. The spoons are well made, too; one sat in my sink for a week and didn’t rust or discolor the way some fashion spoons do,” one caffeinated customer wrote. $23 at Amazon

Unique gifts for Mom

Uncommon Goods Tunisian Tiled Snack Tray Just the right size for her afternoon pick-me-up (or post-work wine and cheese), she’ll be transported to the turquoise waters of Tunisia each and every time she pulls out this tiled tray. Pair it with her snack of choice, so she can put it to use ASAP. $30 at Uncommon Goods

Furbish Studio Furbish Studio Cool Mom Needlepoint Pillow Tell her how you really feel with this cheeky throw pillow (measuring 8"" x 14""). My guess: She’ll put it somewhere where the message is clearly visible so everyone knows the truth. $99 at Furbish Studio

Amazon Misby Coffee Mug Warmer If your mom is the type who likes to sip on her espresso all day, she’s likely complained at some point about the temperature. This super affordable mug warmer is great because it keeps those drinks at 131°F (aka the ideal drinking temperature). Plus, a mug warmer is way less expensive than a heated coffee mug like the bestselling Ember (though we do love it). We highly recommend this affordable option that works with mugs, glass and stainless steel tumblers. $22 at Amazon

Calpak Calpak Luka Duffel Oh, the places Mom will go! Frequent fliers (including my own mom!) love this lightweight, water-resistant weekender, which has all the bells and whistles, including a trolley sleeve, a separate shoe compartment and pockets galore. One swift shopper (and fellow mama) pointed out that she uses it beyond her travels. ""I use my Luka duffel as a bag for my breast pump supplies when I go to work. It should seriously be marketed for this! All of the pockets are so great for storing different parts and snacks, and the shoe pocket is great for the pump itself. The material is awesome because it's so easy to clean."" $138 at Calpak

Beauty and fashion gifts for Mom

Vera Bradley Vera Bradley Blake Crossbody The quilted, cushiony look that Vera Bradley is known for, but more minimalist in nature. Sure, there are plenty of funky prints and patterns to choose from, but the monochromatic styles are best for everyday wear. It checks all the boxes: It has a water-repellent finish, an adjustable strap and enough space to store on-the-go essentials, plus it's versatile enough that one shopper joked she ""had to fight off my daughter for it!"" $45 at Vera Bradley

Nordstrom Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Lip Kit If Mom loves a good nude lip, this Charlotte Tilbury kit has a lip pencil, lipstick and lip gloss that's perfect for any neutral makeup look.

Amazon K. Carroll Accessories Suede Taylor Tote She can pack her daily essentials (and not-so-essentials) in this faux suede carryall.

And I think just about anyone could find a use for them, ” one satisfied customer wrote of the “very expensive-looking” tote. $60 at Amazon

Cariuma Cariuma OCA Low Sneakers in Canvas Style and comfort don’t always go hand in hand, but that certainly doesn’t apply to these kicks. Between the ankle-hugging heel collar and cork insoles, these canvas sneakers are “truly comfort heaven right out of the box,” according to a fan. $89 at Cariuma

Subscriptions and gift experiences for Mom

2025-12-03 17:10:18+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/,The 20 best gifts for teens that they'll actually think are cool in 2025,"You know what's cooler than being cool? These ice-cold gift ideas from Lego, Lululemon and more teen-approved brands. (Photo Illustration: Amanda Garrity/Yahoo News; Amazon, Lululemon)

We need to give teens a little more credit. A lot of us say they're impossible to shop for when Christmas, their birthday or another special occasion comes around, but the problem lies with us. That's right, teens often spell out exactly what they're into, so it's up to the gift-givers to, ya know, listen. And while I encourage you to let them be your guide, I'm here to give you a head start with this list of the best gifts for teens.

How do I determine what makes the cut? I turned straight to the source — some of these picks are dominating my social feeds, others came recommended to me by actual teens in my life. There's a weighted stuffed animal that'll bring the calm, a Lululemon micro bag giving major '90s vibes and tons of trending tech that'll keep 'em connected to their pals. I've laid the groundwork, but you know them best. Keep that in mind as you scroll through these teen-approved gift ideas that'll actually make you look cool. That's what you're after, right? And while you're in a shopping mood, check these top gifts for tweens.

Best gifts for teens overall

Amazon Octobuddy Silicone Suction Phone Mount The next time they want to record a TikTok or snap a few selfies, they can stick their phone to any mirror, window or smooth surface with this nitfy mount. It has 24 powerful suction cups that'll keep in place, so they can better focus on the task at hand. $15 at Amazon

Amazon Warmies Weighted Stuffed Animal This isn't your average stuffie. Nope, they can pop this little guy in the microwave for 90 seconds to bring some soothing relief. It's also has a slight weight to it, which mimics the feeling of being cuddled — the same concept as a weighted blanket, but way cuter. ""It's been a cozy comfort for her on cold nights as a way to have something warm when getting into a cold bed,"" one mom wrote. $28 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $30 at Nordstrom$32 at Ace Hardware

Amazon Loop Lasso Nano Toy Because #TikTokMadeYouBuyIt. It's more than just another viral TikTok favorite, though: This light-bending toy combines physics and cutting-edge technology to shoot glowing string into an array of illuminated formations. And gift-givers, you'll love that it arrives fully charged and with serval spools of string. $35 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $40 at Nordstrom

Target Squishmallows 5"" Scented Mystery Bag Getting your hands on a Labubu blind box is nearly impossible these days, but your teen will get the same thrill when they unveil their scented stuffie. You can't pick their plushie for them. Nope, they'll have to rip open the foil bag to reveal their newest squad member. $8 at Target

Amazon Kodak Step Instant Smartphone Photo Printer Hey, Gen Xers, take your young adult back to your own teen years with actual paper photos. The sticky-backed photos printed from this wireless compact printer are smudge-proof, waterproof and tear-resistant — perfect to decorate bedrooms, lockers, mirrors and more. Simply connect to the printer via Bluetooth and use the Kodak Step Prints app to print vibrant 2 x 3"" photos. $80 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $80 at Macy's$80 at Best Buy

LOGROTATE Logrotate Moon Lamp This Amazon favorite not only looks way pricier than it is, but it makes for an excellent night light — and you'll kind of want one for your own bedroom, too. It even has a remote that your teen can use to make it switch colors. $19 at Amazon

Amazon Soundcore Space One Active Noise Cancelling Headphones Over-the-ear headphones are a fashion statement of sorts. Soundcore makes some of the most aesthetically pleasing ones on the market, but their quality rivals more trendy headphones (the AirPods Max and Sonos Ace, to name a couple) at a fraction of the cost. They made our list of the best wireless noise-cancelling headphones, with our Senior Tech Writer Rick Broida writing that they ""sound perfectly good to my ears"" and the ""noise-cancelling exceeded my expectations given the price point."" $100 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $100 at Best Buy

Best gifts for teen girls

Free People FP Movement Quilted Micro Pouch She's not exactly carrying around a wallet or car keys just yet, so this pint-size pouch will do the trick. It's teeny tiny, but reviewers say it's still big enough to hold a small hand sanitizer, lip balm and hair tie, aka everything she needs while out and about. She can even clip it to her backpack zipper for easy access during the school day. $20 at Free People

Amazon Laneige Dreamy Lip Kit Teens love Laneige — and the brand's buzzy lip treatment is the real MVP. The brand claims that one lip mask is sold globally every two seconds, which makes perfect sense. Get four minis in this fruit-forward set — flavors range from berry to peach iced tea. $22 at Amazon

Lululemon Lululemon City Essentials Mini Shoulder Bag There's a time and a place for a Lululemon belt bag, but this mini shoulder bag is a touch more sophisticated. The style brings major '90s vibes (a bit ahead of her time, I'd say), but the bag's water-repellent fabric, interior pockets and adjustable strap make it far more practical than the ones Mom used to wear. It comes in plenty of neutral shades, but I'd go for lavender or one of the pinks for a fun pop of color. $58 at Lululemon

Amazon Vivinin Flower Claw Clip, 7 Pack If you wore these plastic claw clips in the 90s, chances are your teen wishes you'd saved them. But fear not, you can grab these flower-shaped ones in various colors and styles, at a price point that makes us think we're actually in the 90s again. $7 at Amazon

Amazon Gionlion Friendship Bracelet Kit If your teen is a Swiftie, they'll probably want to make their own friendship bracelets to swap with friends. This kit includes everything they need to get started: over 5,000 clay beads, clear elastic, clasps, scissors and more. $9 at Amazon

Best gifts for teen boys

2025-05-05 18:39:46+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/,The best nontoxic cutting boards will help slice microplastics out of your kitchen,"Many of us reach for plastic cutting boards because of how easy they are to clean and sanitize between meals. But researchers have long known that plastic cutting boards are one of the ways microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) make it into our bodies. So, what are the best nontoxic cutting boards you can switch to?



First, here's some more background on why you might want to replace your old boards: In March 2024, a landmark study showed that microplastics can be found in plaque that builds up in people's arteries, increasing their risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke and heart attack. This brought a renewed focus to the ways plastic can get into our systems — and it appears that our plastic cutting boards are one of the culprits.



""We know that exposure to plastics, often at surprisingly low thresholds, is linked to greater risk of adverse health outcomes like stroke and heart attack,"" says Varun Subramaniam, associate scientist at the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit that provides consumers with information related to potential toxins in commercial products. ""We're also finding that these tiny plastic particles can penetrate our natural defense barriers and enter our organs, potentially causing inflammation, uncontrolled cell growth and immune disruption.""



The process by which minuscule bits of plastic can get into our systems is quite simple, says Subramaniam. ""Chopping causes plastic fragments to dislodge from the board and stick to foods that we consume. This is a rather significant source of plastics in foods — some studies estimate up to 50.7 grams of plastic consumed per person per year is from cutting boards alone.""



And the longer the boards have been in our house, the greater the risk. ""Risk increases as plastic cutting boards develop grooves, which can release more microplastics into food and harbor bacteria,"" says Wesley McWhorter, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""Regularly inspecting and replacing worn boards, especially those with deep scratches, is a practical way to mitigate this risk.""



But, Subramaniam warns, ""even brand-new or barely used plastic cutting boards can release a concerning amount of plastic into our foods."" Safer alternatives include bamboo and wood, which ""are durable and, in the case of wood, have natural antimicrobial properties,"" says McWhorter. ""In my home, I use bamboo for fruits and vegetables and high-density plastic for raw proteins to balance safety and functionality."" This is an important thing to note: There needs to be a give-and-take between safety and practical day-to-day life, and those are decisions that ultimately you as the consumer has to make.



""Making lifestyle changes depends on one's circumstances,"" says Subramaniam. ""However, for those that can do so, these findings warrant switching over from plastic cutting boards to alternatives like ones made from wood or bamboo."" Fortunately, that switch can be made relatively inexpensively. See our list below for options in every price point.

Best materials to replace plastic cutting boards

Hardwood cutting boards

Hardwood is an excellent material to use for cutting boards because it's soft enough to prevent damage to knives while remaining hard enough to resist damage from knives. It's also less porous than softwood, making it durable, long-lasting and resistant to damage. Also, many woods are naturally antimicrobial and antiviral, and there's some evidence that bacterias are less likely to grow on wood surfaces than on plastic ones, although more research needs to be done. Popular options for hardwood cutting boards include:

Advertisement Advertisement

Maple

Walnut

Birch

Acacia

Teak

Oak

Bamboo cutting boards

Bamboo is a great choice because it is sustainable and less porous than hardwoods. It's also harder to scar, which makes it less likely to trap bacteria. Just like with wood cutting boards, be sure to clean bamboo with hot, soapy water and to sanitize periodically. Prime with mineral oil every now and then for longevity.

Paper composite cutting boards

A newcomer to the cutting board market is paper composite. These boards are made from recycled paper that's mixed with food-safe resin then compacted to form the cutting surface. Given that they're not actually wood, they're dishwasher safe and don't have to be oiled to maintain their surface.

Rice fiber or wheat straw fiber cutting boards

Like paper composite boards, rice fiber and wheat straw fiber boards are a new entry in the cutting board world, but they show a lot of promise. Made from rice husks or wheat straw husks, they're eco-friendly, biodegradable, dishwasher safe (generally, although many manufacturers suggest you hand-wash them for longevity) and won't dull or damage your knives.

Glass or stone cutting boards

Glass or stone cutting boards are beneficial for their non-porous surfaces that are easy to clean and (most) can be thrown in the dishwasher. That said, these extra-hard surfaces can be damaging to knives, dulling their edges quickly.

How to clean, care for and use your cutting boards correctly

Regardless of the type of cutting board you select, to ensure food safety you should always follow certain guidelines. Food safety experts recommend that you:

Advertisement Advertisement

Designate specific cutting boards for meat, poultry and seafood and other cutting boards for vegetables or fruits to avoid cross contamination.

Wash with hot, soapy water after each use and dry with a clean towel.

Periodically sanitize wood and other boards made out of porous materials with a solution that is 1 tablespoon bleach to a gallon of water. Pour over the entire surface of the board and allow it to absorb for five minutes before rinsing clean.

Replace cutting boards that are well-worn or have deep grooves where bacteria can make a home and resist your cleaning efforts.

Prime wood and bamboo boards with food-safe mineral oil periodically to maintain their performance.

FAQs

How do I find a safe replacement for my plastic cutting board?

There are pros and cons to just about every cutting board option. However, hardwood and bamboo cutting boards are tried-and-true cutting board solutions that won't dull or damage your knives, provide long-lasting durability and are unlikely to allow for bacterial build-up when cleaned and cared for correctly. You may also want to try new composite cutting boards made from paper, wheat straw or rice husks. These options are eco-friendly, biodegradable and because they're not made from plastic, they won't contribute to microplastic consumption in your foods. They're also convenient, as they're usually dishwasher safe, but be sure to check the manufacturers cleaning suggestions.

Is cutting meat on wooden cutting boards safe?

Yes, as long as you're cleaning and maintaining your wooden cutting boards correctly and following food safety guidelines, cutting meat on hardwood cutting boards is considered safe. While woods can be porous, hardwoods are less porous than softwoods and most wood has natural antibacterial and antiviral properties that can help prevent bacterial growth. Plus, when washed with hot, soapy water immediately following use and disinfected regularly, any risk for bacterial contamination can be prevented.

Are glass cutting boards a better alternative to plastic cutting boards?

While glass cutting boards can be convenient — they're non-porous, easy to clean and dishwasher safe — there are drawbacks. For example, the hard surface isn't great for your knives, which can cause them to wear down quickly.

Lugging around a big, clunky vacuum? We'd rather not, thanks. The best cordless stick vacuums deliver as much — if not more — cleaning power as their bulky counterparts, but are significantly lighter in weight and more nimble. Many can even transform into a handheld vacuum, allowing you to suck up every speck of dust and dirt, no matter where it's hiding.



As Yahoo's resident cleaning expert, I've tested more than 60 of the best vacuums over the past few years (including lightweight models and vacuums designed specifically for pet hair). For this guide, I tested 14 of the best cordless stick vacuums, putting these machines through their paces against a range of floor surfaces and materials. I set up obstacle courses to see how well they could bob and weave and tackled stairs, sofas and other spots with their various attachment tools. In the end, I settled on four glowing (sometimes, literally!) models across various budgets and needs.

Best cordless stick vacuums for 2025

Tineco Best cordless stick vacuum overall Tineco Pure ONE S11 Cordless Vacuum Size: 6.22""L x 12.05""W x 29.68""H | Weight: 7.1 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.6 liters | Run time: 40 minutes | Filter: Yes | Power: 450 watts Leading my list is the Tineco Pure One S11 Smart Stick, which hit the sweet spot in my testing for a sleek vacuum that offers solid performance, along with some snazzy features, at a competitive price. For just about $300, the Tineco Pure One S11 features a narrow brush head that swivels like a dream. It has headlights for seeing under low furniture and in darker spaces. At 7 pounds, the S11 is also lightweight and, as several eavesdroppers noted during my testing, incredibly quiet — enough that it probably wouldn't wake a sleeping baby. The suction was superb in my ""carpet course"" test (more details toward the end of this guide), with the Pure One S11 mowing down faux fur, sand, kitty litter, rice and cereal with ease. It only took one pass to pick up the latter from hardwood surfaces, including most if not all materials pushed up against or crushed into wall trims. Cat hair was no obstacle, and the S11 was able to get all of the dog fur in my ""passenger pet"" test (though it may require an extra go for fur that's matted into dense carpets). In real-life trials, I was able to cover several rooms — or the first floor of a house, plus stairs and some curtain detailing — in what proved a true run time of 40 minutes. Tineco’s S11 boasts a HEPA filter, two power modes (you don't need to hold the switch the whole time you're cleaning) and an LCD screen that displays important reminders, such as when the filter needs swapping. A color-coded ring indicates battery life and tells you when your floor is truly clean. Bonus: The vacuum connects to Tineco's smart app for Wi-Fi enabling and additional features. The dust cup is a cinch to pop open and offers 0.6 liters of space, so you don’t have to keep emptying it. There’s a mini power brush and additional attachments for navigating tight spaces and upholstery. You can set up the included wall mount to charge your vacuum standing or charge the upper vacuum head portion independently (one gripe: you'll need to dock it in the wall mount, as that’s where the outlet wire plugs in). Pros Narrow brush head with lighting for visibility

LCD display with Wi-Fi connectivity

Comes with a mini brush head and other attachments Cons Doesn't display exact battery percentage

The wall plug connects to the mount (versus vacuum head) for charging $169 at Amazon

Kenmore Best value cordless stick vacuum Kenmore Elite Cordless Stick Vacuum Size: 15.75""L x 5.71""W x 21.46""H | Weight: 6 pounds | Bin capacity: 1 liter | Run time: 40 minutes | Filter: Yes | Power: 250 watts For an even lighter lift (both financially and physically), the Kenmore Elite Stick Vacuum performed at the peak of my lowest price category, with a shiny frame and a brush cleaner head that has four light bulbs for added visibility. In testing, I referred to it as ""Tinker Bell"" because it moved swiftly, yet gently and glowed like a fairy. It was easy to set up — three main parts, three clicks — and can be charged in the wall mount dock or plugged right into an outlet. It contains a HEPA filter for capturing 99.97% of pixie (er, dust) particles and features an LCD display that illuminates different colors to indicate charge level and motor speed. You use the switch to start and stop, and can toggle between modes via the button on top (no need to keep holding). The Kenmore Elite offers 40 minutes of run time, which I found accurate and sufficient for tackling several rooms at a time, and performed on par with the Pure One S11 in terms of suction and trimming, only sparing a few deeply creviced rice grains in my “kitchen sink” testing. For being so lightweight — only 6 pounds, with the handheld portion only 3 — the Kenmore Elite has the second biggest dust cup of the vacuums I tested, with a sophisticated release functionality similar to Dyson. The tube is also flexible for getting under shallow areas without having to bend over, making it especially helpful for individuals who have — or don't want — back problems. (Small snag: The Elite only comes with one attachment tool compared to some of my other options, though you can purchase additional accessories without breaking the bank.) Pros Narrow brush head with lighting for visibility

Flexible tube for navigating shallow areas

Sizable dust cup with sophisticated release

Color-coded display ring with motor speed and battery life indicators Cons Doesn’t have battery percentage reads

Only comes with one attachment tool $100 at Amazon

Shark Best cordless stick vacuum for carpets Shark Stratos Cordless Stick Vacuum Size: 13.78""L x 10.24""W x 51.18""H | Weight: 8.9 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.7 liters | Run time: 60 minutes | Filter: Yes | Power: 309 watts Dominating the mid-priced range is the Shark Stratos Cordless Stick Vacuum, which manages to be a lot of things, among them — and especially when it comes to carpets — a total pickup artist. The Stratos' cleaner head is stocked with two brushes — one that grips into rugs and another that pulls in smaller particles on surfaces for additional polishing. It promises the strongest suction of any Shark cordless stick and it delivered — against the other Shark I tested and most of the other brands on my list. While it showed its true prowess in my ""passenger pet"" test, lifting stubborn pet hairs from dense car mats in one mesmerizing pass, the Stratos also performed well on hard floors, eliminating Cheerios, rice and sand in a single swoop and devouring smaller particles against trims and cabinets. Among the Stratos' bells and whistles are an odor diffuser, headlights and an LCD screen that displays battery life and lets you know when the floor is truly clean. At 0.7 liters, the dust cup is pretty generous, and there’s a release lever for added convenience. Unique to all other vacuums I tested, the Stratos is an automatic, meaning it adjusts modes to provide the amount of suction you need while preserving battery life (it offers 60 minutes with a full charge, which allowed me to tackle several cleans while alternating between modes and handheld use in between). Unique to other non-Shark vacuums I tested, the brush cleaner head can be hinged at a 90° angle so it doesn't dangle when you transfer it from room to room. And with the center of the tube folded down and the vacuum head plugged in, you can charge the Stratos in its entirety, right in place, wherever there's an outlet present.

Dyson Best cordless stick vacuum for hardwood floors Dyson V12 Detect Slim Origin Cordless Vacuum Cleaner Size: 9.9""L x 9.8""W x 49.1""H | Weight: 5.22 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.34 liters | Run time: 60 minutes | Filter: Yes | Power: 150 watts Last but certainly not least is the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, which is a lean, mean — sometimes fluorescent green! — cleaning machine. Like all the Dyson models I tested, the Dyson V12 Detect Slim consists of three main pieces: a vacuum head upper (handheld portion), a long tube and a brush cleaner head. You can put it together in a matter of seconds and charge it using the wall mount or by plugging the vacuum head right into an outlet. Dyson’s HEPA filters are washable for easy maintenance, and their dust cup levers eject debris with force, so there’s not much (if any) manual cleanup. The Dyson V12 Detect Slim comes with the brand’s traditional suite of accessories, including a crevice tool and a mini anti-screw brush tool for tackling couch cushions, car interiors and other nooks and crannies. What sets this stick apart from some Dyson models (like the Dyson V8) is that it offers 60 minutes of runtime and has a sophisticated LCD screen with battery life, modes, and cleaning reads. What sets it apart from most Dyson models is that it’s powered with a push button (meaning you don’t have to keep pressing the operating switch). But what I really geeked out on, and why I'm choosing the V12 Detect Slim for my hardwood category, is that it comes with a special fluffy brush roller — complete with a neon green light that illuminates everything in its path — for hard surfaces specifically. It got every bit of material in my“kitchen sink” test, no matter how small or creviced the grain. Because the roller is soft and the brush cleaner head is narrow and nimble, I was able to use it against walls and in tighter spaces, such as around bathroom toilets, without having to swap in different attachments or worry about banging up baseboards. At just over 5 pounds, this sleek specimen also happens to be the most lightweight I tested, gliding over hardwood surfaces gently but swiftly without scuffing them. I felt like I was in the latest ""Ghostbusters"" movie when using this (it's that cool) and referred to it as ""the closer"" because I relied on it to zap any materials left behind during testing segments (I’ve continued to use it in my apartment, which is hardwood save for some throw rugs, since). My only complaint is that the dust cup is among the smaller ones on my list. That, and the fact that the soft brush is, well, sort of addictive to use. Shopping tip: I opted for the Dyson V12 Detect Slim here because it’s the most affordable and lightweight of the brand’s “Detect” family (that, and the press button is super convenient). The traditional anti-tangle brush cleared hair and other materials from carpets. If you’d like a little more carpet traction (say for really thick rugs or homes with pets), the Dyson V15 Detect and Dyson Gen5detect offer the same illuminating fluffy brush, but with larger dust cups, more suction power and an optimizable anti-tangle cleaner brush head with three surface settings (something that made a difference in my “passenger pet” test). Additionally, the Gen5detect boasts an extra ten minutes of run time, plus an On/Off button, for those who prefer to be more hands-free. Keep scrolling for more info on the Dyson cordless stick vacuums I evaluated. Pros Slim fluffy cleaner head with laser for hardwood visibility

Attachments include a mini hair screw tool for smaller surfaces and tighter spaces

Digital display with mode, battery and cleanliness reads Cons Detangling cleaner head doesn’t have lighting

Factors to consider when choosing a cordless stick vacuum

Size: Higher stick vacuums generally equate to longer tubes and greater reach, particularly helpful for those who are tall or navigating vast, shallow surface areas (like beneath platform beds). That said, more height means you’ll be farther from your target, in which case extendable or flexible tubes can help with maneuverability (and lights can help with visibility). Longer brush rolls mean fewer swipes for wider floors but they may need turning when tackling narrow areas, such as under a small nightstand. Wider brushes require shorter strokes for longer floors but may necessitate additional swipes for wider surfaces.



Weight: The lighter the vacuum, the easier the lift (and steer). Lightweight designs glide across hardwood floors seamlessly but can have a difficult time bearing down on, say, thick carpets. Lighter models tend to be associated with smaller dust cups, though not always, and fewer tech components (like LCD screens and respective engineering that can prove top-heavy).



Cup capacity: Larger cups house more dirt so you don’t have to take as many trips to the trash can. Most of the stick vacuums I scouted — and tested — fell between 0.4 and 0.8 liters, with the Kenmore Elite at 1 liter plus and the Dyson Outsize taking the lead with almost 2 liters. Aside from capacity, I preferred cups with lids that opened automatically with the help of a lever (usually on the side or along the backside of the bin) versus having to manually unclip the lids and, in some cases, having to reach my fingers in.



Glow-getter: The Dyson V12 Detect Slim’s soft brush illuminates everything in its path fluorescent green — and it's fun to see! (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life) (Dyson)

Runtime: According to my research, the average cordless stick vacuum runtime hovers around 30 to 40 minutes for a budget-friendly model, 40 to 50 minutes for mid-priced and 50 minutes or above for luxury, with the Dyson Gen5detect topping my list at 70 minutes. I suggest at least 40 to 50 minutes for multi-floor jobs, and thorough cleanings incorporating ""max"" modes and attachments. Most of the cordless stick vacuum cleaners I tried require four(ish) hours of charging to reach full battery potential.



Filter type: A lot of cordless stick vacuums available today are equipped with a filter for zapping pollutants and improving air quality, with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters considered the gold standard. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), HEPA filters ""theoretically remove at least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and any airborne particles with a size of 0.3 microns,"" with larger or smaller particles “trapped with even higher efficiency.” Follow instruction manuals for how and when to replace filters for optimal results (many, like Dyson, now use washable filters for cost efficiency).



Wattage: A higher wattage often correlates to greater suction power. High-voltage batteries generally have a longer shelf life, or runtime, so you can tackle more space or several vacuum jobs in one go without recharging.



Brushes and attachments: Most of the cordless stick vacuums I tested come with a detangling brush roller that can be used for multiple floor types including carpets, some with an additional soft brush roller for hard surfaces. Brush cleaner headlights offer more visibility in low lighting and beneath furniture, while mini roller attachments help tackle tighter spaces (such as inside your car; they’re also great for getting stubborn pet fur from couch interiors). Brush tools aid in detailing and spot-treating (cushions, curtains), whereas crevice tools are a must for navigating ceilings and wall corners.



Docking and storing: With freestanding docks, you don't have to screw a wall mount into place to keep your stick vacuum upright. Alternatively, all of the vacuum head ""uppers"" on this list can be charged separately via plug. You just have to then reattach them to the vacuum tube and cleaner head base when finished.

No mount, no problem: The Tineco Pure One S15 comes with a freestanding, preassembled dock. The Shark Stratos tucks down and relies on its cleaner head as a base, for mobile stationing. (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life)

How we tested cordless stick vacuums

I set up several obstacle courses to test these cordless stick vacuums against materials with varying shapes, textures and depths on different surfaces (carpet and hardwood) and their respective attachments on sofa and other upholsteries. Additionally, I put them through their paces in real-life scenarios, prioritizing homes that needed a good cleaning and/or had pet inhabitants. The nitty gritty:

""Carpet course"" test: I spaced out materials — faux fur, rice, Cheerios, kitty litter and sand — across a plush carpet to see how the vacuums managed to cut through the clutter.

""Kitchen sink"" test: I poured rice and Cheerios on a hardwood kitchen floor to gauge how well the vacuums could get a grip — especially against trims and in cabinet crevices.

""Passenger pet"" test: I asked family and friends to avoid vacuuming for a week, then used car mats to collect the fur their pet companions had shed, to see which vacuums had the best suction.

""Vacs gone wild"" test: I didn’t stop there! I clocked over 30 hours testing these vacuums in different houses and settings to see if they could rise to different occasions.

Risky business: I sucked up faux fur, rice, kitty litter, Cheerios and sand on a plush carpet for one of my ""Carpet Course"" tests. (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life)

Other cordless stick vacuums we tested

Dyson V8 Cordless Stick Vacuum: This is among Dyson's more compact and budget-conscious Dyson models and a touch taller and longer than the V7 with a slightly wider brush head and a bit more pickup. The vacuum maneuvers effortlessly over and around rugs and hardwood floors, and the hair screw tool worked miracles when it came to tight corners and detailing pet-loved couch interiors. The carpet suction isn't on the level of what I found with Dyson’s adjustable brush cleaner head (more below). Because of this, combined with the smaller dust cup (0.4 liters) and shorter runtime (40 minutes; I clocked 25 minutes when toggling between the higher power mode), I suggest it for smaller spaces with hardwood floors or shallow carpets and quicker jobs. Of note, the V8 doesn't have a digital display with battery life readings, so you don't know when it’s going to stop.

Dyson V11 Cordless Stick Vacuum: With this vac, you get the same roller brush, attachments and operation style as the V8 but with a tad taller and heavier yet still incredibly nimble frame (yay, upgrades!). For around a $90 price increase (before sales), you get extended runtime (60 minutes total) and a bigger cup size, ideal for tackling multiple rooms (I also found the cup release lever, located on the underbelly of the bin, more effective at ridding waste than the V8). Plus, you get an LCD interface displaying power modes — in this case, three — along with battery life readings for keeping track of your juice.

Dyson Outsize Cordless Stick Vacuum: Essentially a jumbo-sized Dyson (hence the name), this vac is the tallest and has the longest, widest brush roller, plus the largest cup capacity, of the Dyson vacuums I tried. It functions similarly to the Dyson V11 (there’s an LCD screen, three modes and a 60-minute runtime; the attachments are the same), but the Outsize has an adjustable cleaner head that allows you to toggle between three settings. The ""-"" optimizes performance for hardwood floors and the ""+"" offers better traction on carpets, a difference that really stood out in my ""kitchen sink"" and ""carpet course"" tests. It's a worthy splurge for bigger homes and wide, open spaces such as basements.

Dyson V15 Detect: This Dyson is slightly heavier and pricier than the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, equipped with the same attachments, runtime, LCD screen and neon-emitting fluffy brush, which comes in handy when you want to do a deep cleaning. As mentioned above, it has a larger dust cup (0.8 liters), a bit more pickup (240 watts) and an adjustable anti-tangle roller brush that can be optimized for hardwood (""-"") or thick rug (""+"") surfaces, which appeared to make a difference in my traditional ""kitchen sink"" and ""passenger pet"" tests. The catch? As with most Dyson stick vacuums, you need to continuously press the V15 Detect's power switch to keep it going.

Dyson's gen5Detect: You'll get the same bells and whistles as the Dyson V15 Detect — a detangling digital cleaner head and fluffy laser cleaner head, attachments and equal dust cup capacity — with slightly more power and a battery life of 70 minutes. The digital readouts are a nudge more sophisticated and — unique to all of the Dyson vacuums I tested except one — there’s a Start/Stop button versus a switch. It can be a little awkward to press the top button with one hand in the handle groove, and the vacuum is slightly top-heavy, but the button means you can relax your finger as you move. I would have given this best overall from a pure performance standpoint if I didn't consider price as a factor for the category.

Sleek lineup: A selection of non-Dyson cordless stick vacuums prepare to go head-to-head in a range of tests to determine the best. (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life)

Tineco Pure One S15 Pet Smart Stick Vacuum (currently out of stock): This delivers one of the sleekest designs and smartest digital displays in its price range. Like many of the other vacuums on this list, it can be set up in a matter of seconds and comes with an equally minimalistic-looking, freestanding charging mount that requires no assembly. The LCD screen is similar to the Pure One S11, with Wi-Fi connectivity and a color-coded halo to distinguish the level of cleanliness, plus battery reads, and the brush cleaner head has ample light for visibility. As evident in our ""passenger pet"" test, the suction is a bit stronger than the Tineco Pure One S11 (just behind the Dyson and Shark vacuums I tested) and attachments include a mini anti-tangle brush for getting into grooves. Of note: there were a few instances where the S15 had trouble holding down its meals, spitting out finer particles such as rice from our ""kitchen sink"" test (should you want to vacuum up such things).

Shark Rocket Pet Pro Cordless Stick Vacuum: It has some of the most powerful suction of the cordless stick vacuums I tried. In ""boost"" mode, comparable or just behind the Dyson Detects and Shark Stratos in our ""passenger pet"" test. In our ""kitchen sink"" test, regardless of the mode, it gobbled everything in its path — even down to finer Cheerio pieces and (most) rice particles in cabinet edges. Like the Stratos, it has a headlight for visibility and you can hinge the tube and brush cleaner head for controlled carrying; you don't need a wall mount to charge it standing. I like how the Samsung Stratos automatically adjusts its modes based on the job at hand (for the Rocket, you select between ""hardwood"" and ""carpet"" modes but have to hold the ""boost"" lever throughout) — and offers 20 additional minutes of run time. All things considered, the Rocket is still a solid choice for pet owners or anyone else who's looking for serious pickup on a smaller-than-Dyson dime.

Bissell's IconPet Cordless Stick Vacuum: This stick vacuum is designed with an anti-tangle brush and a glowy LED brush cleaner headlight that illuminates fur and other fine fibers. It fell in the mid-range for weight (8 pounds) and cup size (0.4 liters) amidst my testing group and navigated regular carpets and hardwood floors just fine. It boasts an LED crevice and dusting brush tool and mini LED brush tool for added visibility and versatility. But the IconPet didn’t perform as well as some vacuums in my ""passenger pet"" test, requiring a few passes to get the fur out of the car mats. In the ""kitchen sink"" test, it had some trouble swallowing Cheerios, spitting them out here and there. In ""turbo"" mode, this baby sounds like a turbojet, so I wouldn’t recommend using it if someone is sleeping or you have very thin walls.

Hoover OnePwr Blade+ (currently out of stock): Easy to put together and operate, this vacuum lets you charge the battery on its own without the vacuum head for added convenience. With the brush cleaner headlight on, it performed great in my “carpet course"" test and fine in my ""kitchen sink"" test (save for some smaller particles here and there, usually against ledges). It struggled without the cleaner brush headlight on, however, stumbling on Cheerios and skipping particles of sand. It got clogged a few times and released some materials through the cleaner head while in use or when shuffled from room to room. Additionally, I wish the cup size were bigger (it’s only 0.3 liters) and that I didn’t have to unclip it from the rest of the vacuum for emptying (though it’s a clean release, so I didn't need to put my hands in).

Cordless stick vacuum FAQs

What is the difference between a stick vacuum and an upright vacuum?

Stick vacuums typically consist of a vacuum head, complete with a battery, dust cup, filter, control buttons, and sometimes a digital display screen (think of the head, or “upper,” as its central processing and operating unit). The head attaches to a thin tube, which then connects to a brush cleaner head with roller(s). Alternatively, the ""upper"" can be attached to various attachment tools (versus the tube) for handheld use.

Like many upright vacuums designed today, stick vacuums are often bagless (thanks to their dust cups), the biggest distinguisher being that stick vacuums are usually cordless. Because of this, you can move them around a room or home freely, though you’ll have to charge — and are limited to — the battery. Given their svelte silhouettes, cordless stick vacuums also tend to be more nimble and storage-friendly.

Are stick vacuums heavy?

Not typically. Part of what makes stick vacuums so nimble is that they’re generally lightweight. Most of the stick vacuums I evaluated weigh in at around 6 or 7 pounds when completely configured, with Kenmore Elite and Homeika Pro handhelds weighing in at just over 3 (meaning fewer back aches and less elbow grease).

Are stick vacuums good for the carpet?

Because cordless stick vacuums tend to be lighter and less powerful than corded upright vacuums, they are thought not to “hunker down” quite like corded upright vacuums. That said, I experienced good rug traction with the models I tested, especially when it came to Tineco (may need an extra pass), Shark (hold your throws!) and Dyson (the V8 and V11 being adequate, with the Dyson Outsize, Dyson V15 Detect and Dyson Gen5detect including ""+"" toggle on the brush head for even greater suction power against plush carpets).

Let's be honest: You’re probably not getting enough H2O. Health experts recommend drinking 4 to 6 cups of water daily for optimal organ function, among other benefits — like slowing the aging process — and the best water bottles are a great ally for helping you get your necessary sips. A reusable water bottle can also save you — and the environment — from all those single-use bottles you might otherwise buy just to throw away.



But with so many brands and designs, how does one choose? Well, we’ve done all the heavy lifting for you. More specifically, we've sorted through thousands of customer comments and tested over 100 water bottles over the course of several months in an attempt to find the most versatile, durable options for every occasion. From car-friendly tumblers (BrüMate's Era Tumbler steals the lane) to sporty flip straws (Takeya's Sport Insulated bottle wins the game), read on for the best water bottles of 2025, tested and reviewed.

Amazon Best glass water bottle Lifefactory Glass Water Bottle, 16 oz. Material: Glass with silicone sleeve | Cap: Active Flip | Volume: 12, 16 or 22 ounces Best for: Everyday hydrating and anyone who prefers glass over plastic or stainless steel While glass bottles typically weigh more than their plastic and stainless steel counterparts, they have a lot going for them. They are non-reactive to any drink mixes or juices you might add, they're BPA-free, and they'll never turn on you and start tasting like plastic or stainless steel after years of use. This guzzler from Lifefactory rose to the top as our favorite pick. The Active Flip Cap easily flipped up (hence the name) and clicked closed with a tight seal that proved leakproof. The full lid screws off to reveal a wide mouth that was easy to fill with ice cubes of all sizes. A silicone sleeve (available in different hues) surrounds the bottle for less condensation and a better grip (especially important for breakable glass bottles), and there’s a sturdy strap for agile handling when on the move.

Walmart Best travel water bottle LifeStraw Go Water Filter Bottle, 22 oz. Material: Tritan plastic | Cap: Flip straw | Volume: 22 ounces Best for: Traveling, hiking and backpacking Securing our spot for the best travel water bottle is LifeStraw’s Go Water Bottle. It has a lightweight yet durable Tritan plastic body with a carabiner that clips securely to your bags and luggage. The straw is easy to drink from and verifiably leakproof when closed. The main draw, however, is the bottle’s integrated filtration system, which promises to protect against 99.999999% of bacteria and 99.999% of parasites. This feature is particularly helpful when charting new territory without access to a clean-water system or refilling at questionable water fountains. The two-filter system incorporates an activated carbon filter and a membrane microfilter. The first lasts about 26 gallons, and the latter lasts up to 1,000 gallons, so you won’t have to worry about changing filters while traveling. Additionally, we appreciate the brand's commitment to clean water for all: For every purchase, the brand promises to donate one year of safe water to a child in need. This is a great design to have on hand for upcoming trips, outdoor adventures and in case of emergency. Traveling light? LifeStraw sells collapsible water bottles and filtration straws for more compact stashing during crowded flights and longer hauls. Pros Lightweight

Takeya Best sports water bottle Takeya Sport Insulated Water Bottle with Ice Blocking Spout Lid, 22 ounces Material: Stainless steel | Cap: Spout Lid with Ice Blocker or Straw Lid | Volume: 22, 32, 40 or 64 ounces Best for: Exercising at the gym or outdoors Akin to Hydro Flask and Yeti, Takeya offers insulated water bottles that keep drinks cold and are easy to clean, plus interchangeable cap styles for evolving needs. The durable, 22-ounce Takeya Sport Premium Insulated Water Bottle fits comfortably in hand and has a spout-style lid with a built-in ice blocker for streamlined drinking. This makes it ideal for getting gulps in while playing sports or working out at the gym. The lid twists off easily for quick fill-ups and has a carrying loop for maneuvering. A removable bumper helps protect against dings should you drop your bottle while running. In our experience, the bottle is spill-proof when the lid is secure — meaning your gym bag won't get soggy — and is compatible with cup holders on treadmills and other workout equipment.

Stanley Best flip-straw water bottle Stanley IceFlow Stainless Steel Tumbler with Straw, 30 ounces Material: 18/8 stainless steel | Cap: Flip straw | Volume: 20, 24, 30, 40, 64 or 96 ounces Best for: Trend lovers and the status brand-obsessed Heritage brand Stanley has reentered the tumbler chat (more like expanded its social circles) with the help of some savvy marketing and limited-edition collections. The brand even released a highly anticipated collab with soccer star Leo Messi earlier this year. Like the ever-popular Stanley FlowState Quencher, the Stanley IceFlow’s canister is made of stainless steel for maximum durability, complete with double-wall vacuum insulation and available in a rainbow of shade combos. Unlike the FlowState, the IceFlow proved 100% leak-proof with the flip straw folded (the FlowState lid can be closed with the straw removed, but water can still trickle out when turned over). Because you can easily flip the IceFlow straw down when not in use, dirt and debris aren't as likely to get through. The foldable, flexible lid handle makes for compact packing and easy carrying. Consider it a shoo-in for commutes, weekend trips and campouts. It's also tween-friendly: My 10-year-old niece and her schoolmates love the 20-ounce version for hydrating between classes and recreational activities. Pros Insulated

Owala Best hybrid water bottle Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Straw Material: Stainless steel | Cap: FreeSip spout with locking lid | Volume: 16, 24, 32 or 40 ounces Best for: Anyone who likes the flexibility of going between a straw and a chug top Want the ability to toggle between a straw and a chug top? The Owala FreeSip offers the best of both worlds and is a Yahoo editor favorite for its versatility and temperature retention. The hero feature is a patented 2-in-1 spout with a built-in straw for sipping and a wider opening for chugging. We were also fans of the push-button cap, which protected the spout and offered leak protection — even when tossed in a bag. The FreeSip features vacuum-insulated stainless steel that kept our drinks cold for up to 24 hours, and we loved the varied color options. While technically dishwasher-safe, the brand recommends hand-washing the cup portion and avoiding hot liquids. Pros Insulated

Amazon Best filtered water bottle Larq Insulated Filtered Water Bottle, 17 ounces 3Material: Stainless steel | Cap: Flip straw | Volume: 17 or 25 ounces Best for: Outdoor adventures or anytime you want extra filtration If you have the money to splurge — or perhaps some loved ones to spoil — Larq's Insulated Filtered Water Bottle is a worthy investment. According to the brand, the activated carbon in the two-layer filter traps contaminants like lead, chlorine, VOCs and other particulates, using a custom Nano Zero technology to latch on to heavy metals, so you have access to purified water — even from a garden hose. Aside from its filtration element, which the brand recommends renewing every 40 gallons or two months, the Larq Water Bottle has a durable stainless steel canister and an environmentally friendly powder coat for added grip and sustainability. An exterior cap offers additional leak protection, and the bottle keeps drinks cold for hours, as confirmed in our evaluation. We also like that there's a carabiner for attaching the water bottle to a tote or backpack when commuting. Pros Insulated

S'well Best tapered water bottle S’well Original Insulated Water Bottle, Original Cap, 25 ounces Material: 18/8 stainless steel | Cap: Original, Sports or Flip straw | Volume: 9, 17 or 25 ounces Best for: Design lovers While the S’Well Original Bottle caught our attention for its gorgeous designs and patterns spanning from warm woods to earthy textures to vibrant celestial motifs, this bottle proved to be far more than just a pretty face. The tapered shape, the triple-walled stainless steel body and the tight-sealing screw top lid made for some powerful insulation. This bottle was my favorite office companion during testing, keeping water cold for more than 24 hours and never sweating condensation on my desk or notes. Plus, the bottle cap screws on tight so as not to leak water all over my work tote. The 17-ounce fits comfortably in a backpack holder, though the Original Bottle comes in different sizes for varying thirst levels. You can also purchase a Bottle Handle for easy carrying or a Sports Cap for when you don't feel like tinkering with a lid. If you want to match your water bottle to your food storage container, S'well also makes stylish salad bowls for on-the-go enjoyment. Pros Insulated

Amazon Best non-handled tumbler Corkcicle Cold Cup Insulated Tumbler with Lid and Straw, 24 oz Material: Stainless steel | Cap: Straw or Sliding | Volume: 16 or 24 ounces Best for: Stationary sipping and design lovers Corkcicle's 24-ounce Cold Cup with Straw holds a substantial amount of liquid and kept our chilled drinks cold — from waters to iced cappuccinos — for hours. This design features easy-grip sides, making it slip-resistant against sweaty or wet hands, and a silicone bottom that proved more stabilizing than others we tested. All these reasons and the fun mix of patterns — including cute design collaborations — secure this tumbler as a top pick for pool days and shore trips. Keep in mind, however, that while the lids seal tight, the straws don't close, so you'll want to empty the cups before tossing them in your beach bag.) Pros Insulated

BrüMate Best handled tumbler BrüMate Era Tumbler with Handle and Straw, 40 ounces Material: Stainless steel | Cap: Straw | Volume: 30 or 40 ounces Best for: Hydrating on the go Large, handled tumblers, also known as cruisers, have risen as the ultimate hydration accessory for their ability to hold— and keep cold — high volumes of water while still managing to fit in a car cup holder. What sets BrüMate’s insulated Era Tumbler apart from the rest is that it features a custom straw-locking dial that can be turned from ""Sip"" when drinking to ""Sealed,"" blocking water flow and rendering it 100% leak-proof, as confirmed when vigorously shaken upside down. The straw is stainless steel, making it more sanitary and sustainable than plastic options, and we found the Era's angled handle to be more comfortable than traditional handles for carrying. This tumbler is also dishwasher-safe and comes apart easily for cleaning. Pros Insulated

Factors to consider when choosing a water bottle

Some things to think about when shopping for water bottles include:

Material:

Stainless steel water bottles are increasingly popular for their often indestructible frames and typically colorful, sweat-resistant coats. When insulated, they also keep drinks cold or hot for extended periods.

Plastic water bottles are tumble-friendly and usually most lightweight, making them a common choice for younger kids and longer treks. While not as shatter- or condensation-proof as stainless steel, many water bottles today are Tritan plastic, a durable, BPA-free alternative to traditional plastic compounds.

Glass water bottles tend to weigh more than their plastic and stainless steel counterparts, with an inclination to sweat and, with enough impact, break. That said, they’re generally dishwasher-safe and made without any perceived toxins that can latch on or react to liquids (keep scrolling for more on water bottle safety.)

Bright idea: Scoop up a colorful water bottle, lid or sleeve to add some pep to your gym step or make someone else's day. (Owala via Instagram)

Cap/straw: Chug caps are great for hearty gulps, while narrow mouths make for a more controlled sip. Traditional straw tumblers allow for more distance between you and your tumbler — and flip straws offer quick, discreet access for sneaking in sips when you’re biking, hiking, etc. Because flip straw bottles can be folded down, they also help keep dirt and debris out. Interchangeable caps offer more versatility for evolving needs and growing families (they’re also a cinch for small spaces and traveling).

Volume: Bigger cups mean fewer fill-ups, but they can get more burdensome to carry for longer periods of time. Look for a handle — or at least a cap loop — for more security, especially when traveling or driving, and ensure bottles are compatible with cup holders if you plan to take them for a drive.

Care: Dishwasher-safe water bottles make for easier, more effective cleaning (as long as your dishwasher is clean itself). For bottles that are hand-wash only, you’ll want to invest in some good bottle brushes, especially for water bottles with narrow mouths.

How we tested these water bottles

We did a good amount of groundwork when approaching our best water bottle roundup ... after all, something as vital as water consumption shouldn't be taken lightly! We researched top brands in the industry, scouring through thousands of comments from verified customers to get a handle (get it?) on the water bottle styles and features that matter most.

We then tested top brands and styles accordingly, looking at things like:

Durability: We purposely dropped plastic and stainless steel water bottles from high heights to assess for any damage.

Leak resistance: We filled water bottles up with water and tipped them over to ensure that, when lids were closed, nothing seeped out.

Maintenance: We ran water bottles labeled as dishwasher-safe through several dishwasher cycles to confirm they weren't compromised in the process.

Insulation: Every stainless steel water bottle in our top picks kept our drinks cold for at least a full day, and none of them sweated thanks to their condensation-proof coatings.

Other water bottles we've tested and liked

As mentioned earlier in this roundup, we’ve tested more than 100 water bottles as longtime home editors who evaluate products for a living. Below, a few honorable mentions for additional steel, plastic and glass water bottles that almost made the cut:

Advertisement Advertisement

Stainless steel: We prioritized the Hydro Flask Standard Mouth for its flex straw and carrying handle, but, for a jug style, the Yeti Rambler also ranks high for versatility (extensive colorways and accessories), insulation and durability. I’ve used mine for several years and it remains in good condition. The brand’s equally tough and vibrant Jr. Rambler has also been a big hit with kids in my family.

Glass: We liked how the silicone cover on the Lifefactory Glass Bottle made for a more secure grip (and, therefore, fewer opportunities for slips). Though for a minimalist design, we also reviewed and now regularly use Waterdrop’s Glass Water Bottle. It comes in different sizes and cap styles, available with colorful neoprene sleeves for another layer of cushioning and condensation-proofing.

Flip-straw: Stanley IceFlow’s generous, sturdy handle is among the most comfortable we tested, and the slightly larger canister and straw really quench a thirst. But, if you’re on a budget and looking for a more affordable alternative, the Bottle Bottle Insulated Water Bottle comes with double-wall insulation and an extended flip straw for precise sips. When properly sealed, it also didn't spill during our assessment.

Plastic: While it isn’t as light (or large) as Nalgene, and doesn’t come in as many colors, Pogo’s Plastic Water Bottle fared well in our testing for those who prefer a more precise sip and/or cupholder-friendly option, still with measurements.

Advertisement Advertisement

Filtered: Larq got the top spot for its double filtration and sleek aesthetic, complete with a carabiner for easily attaching it to backpacks and work totes. Though Brita’s Stainless Steel Water Bottle offers insulation, filtration and leak- and spout protection for a less costly option that still does the trick.

Leak-proof tumblers: We went with the BrüMate Era above because it’s designed more like, and was therefore most impressive of, a traditional straw tumbler. But, for a handled tumbler, when the flip straw is folded down, the HydroJug Traveler is equally impressive when it comes to insulation and leak-resistance, making it especially helpful for throwing in a bag when commuting.

What about the Stanley Quencher FlowState? As other Yahoo writers have pointed out, the Stanley Quencher tumbler is great for keeping hydrated when working, driving and more. But the FlowState wasn’t completely leakproof in our testing, which is why we gave the top-handled tumbler spot to BrüMate Era.

Water bottle FAQs

What water bottle material is best for your health?

Glass water bottles are typically made without chemicals that can leach into liquids, making them a top choice (though they are more prone to breaking). Stainless steel bottles are a close second, provided they are made from food-grade, non-reactive materials such as 18/8 or 304 stainless steel.

Advertisement Advertisement

Many major brands now commit to producing water bottles — including those made from plastic or silicone — without known or suspected harmful substances such as Bisphenol A (BPA) or lead. These products are often subject to regular testing and compliance with safety standards.

By contrast, single-use plastic bottles have been linked with the presence of microplastics, which can potentially leach into the water over time and may pose health and environmental concerns.

For added peace of mind, look for labels such as “BPA-free” and “lead-free,” and don’t hesitate to contact brands directly if you need more detailed information. To keep your water bottles clean, we recommend using bottle brushes for narrow-mouth designs and placing bottles in the dishwasher when they are marked dishwasher-safe. With proper maintenance, filtered water bottles can offer an extra layer of protection against bacteria, microplastics and other potential contaminants.

How many bottles of water should I drink a day?

Medical studies suggest drinking 4 to 6 cups of water daily for healthy body function. When converted to measurements, that would equate to 32 to 48 ounces, meaning you’d be just about covered with your 32-ounce or 40-ounce Stanley. That recommendation is for the average person on an average day, so you may need to increase your intake based on your personal needs and level of physical activity, i.e. replenishing more frequently when exercising aggressively.

Can I bring an empty water bottle through TSA?

Reusable water bottles are a great resource for staying hydrated and saving money while traveling (versus having to purchase single-use water bottles at the airport or your destination at an inflated rate). According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), water bottles are approved for both checked and carry-on bags when containing less than 3.4 ounces of liquid. We recommend emptying bottles before going through security and replenishing them at a refill station when finished to be safe.

A good vacuum cleaner should be powerful, nimble and easy to tote around. The best vacuums for 2025 take it up a notch with innovative features and hardworking accessories. Think: automatic gear-shifting, fluorescent lights that illuminate the tiniest dust particles and savvy tools that enable you to get into every crevice.



To find these machines, our team of home and tech writers — who have decades of experience covering and evaluating appliances — tested more than 80 vacs, including cordless stick and upright models as well as robot vacuums and handheld car options. We used them on various surfaces, from hardwood to high-pile carpets, and materials (Cheerios and kitty litter were involved!).

Best vacuums for 2025

Amazon Best upright vacuum Shark PowerDetect Upright Vacuum Cleaner Size: 12.01""L x 15.12""W x 46.18""H | Weight: 17.08 pounds | Bin capacity: 1.9 liters | Vacuum type: Corded upright | Filter: Yes, HEPA | Power: 1,416 watts Topping our list of best upright vacuums is the Shark PowerDetect, which looks almost intergalactic and leverages a network of sensors to adapt to different environments and zap everything in sight. How it works: The Shark PowerDetect includes a detangling cleaner head with two brush rolls and an odor-neutralizing pod, a HEPA filter, a large 1.9-liter dust cup, a long hose and a wand with a handle and controls. The wand clips into the cleaner head base, and the cup clips to the front of the wand. There are buttons along the canister for detaching the dust cup for emptying or, separately, lifting it away (with the motor intact) for detailing corners, stairs and upholsteries. Power settings are located along the top portion of the handle for easy reach. They let you select your floor type or put the vacuum in ""Detect"" mode, which automatically adjusts its suction. Why it's great: For being on the heavier side (a common feature among vacuums with strong motors and sizable dust cups), the Shark PowerDetect is incredibly agile, with swivel steering for optimal maneuverability and a shallow cleaner head that allowed us to get under and around furniture. The two-brush system meant more traction, additional coverage and shorter passes (less time and energy!), while LED lights helped with visibility. The cord length is also 30 feet, on the longer side for a vacuum in the upright category. The PowerDetect proved a match for a variety of messes, sucking up Cheerios, rice, kitty litter, sand and stubborn pet fur, including against the edges of cabinets. The anti-wrap-style brush cleaner head worked well, with no issues of hair getting caught or tangling. When we put this Shark vacuum into automatic ""Detect"" mode, we were able to harness its powerful pickup to navigate multi-surface homes with abandon, cruising from bare floors to low-pile and plush carpets smoothly. This feature was particularly helpful when it came to smaller areas of carpet, like kitchen mats, because it used just enough suction to vacuum effectively without getting stuck or pulling up corners. Based on our experience, that's not an easy feat! Read more in our guide to the best Shark vacuums. Pros ""Detect"" mode automatically adjusts suction

Bissell Best budget vacuum Bissell CleanView Swivel Bagless Upright Vacuum Size: 13""L x 14""W x 46""H | Weight: 15 pounds | Bin capacity: 1 liter | Vacuum type: Corded upright | Filter: Yes | Power: 1,800 watts For a budget-friendly upright — also designed with pets in mind — Bissell's CleanView Swivel is top of the line. How it works: The CleanView Swivel consists of a cleaner head, a bagless canister, an extendable hose and a wand with a handle. To operate it, you plug in the cord and choose one of five surface settings. There are two foot pedals in the back of the vacuum, one for releasing the wand and one for turning the vacuum off and on. Why it's great: This well-rounded warrior aced both our ""carpet course"" and ""kitchen sink"" tests (read more about them below), sucking up every speck in its path right up to the edges of furniture and cabinets. It also picked up most of the fur in our pet-hair test. The swivel steering makes maneuvering it a breeze. The adjustable settings allowed us to optimize for various floor types and carpet thicknesses. But where the Bissell CleanView Swivel really stood out is with its thoughtful attachments, which clip onto the vacuum so they're always handy. The two-in-one dusting brush and crevice tool helped us access hard-to-reach spots, while the real hero — the TurboEraser tool — is one of the few attachments we've ever tested that could remove deeply matted cat fur from an embroidered sofa. It left it looking like new! If you have pets and/or an extra $30ish to spend, there's also a pet-friendly version of this vacuum with an extra ""corner"" attachment, plus automatic cord rewind.

Amazon Best cordless stick vacuum Dyson Gen5detect Cordless Vacuum Cleaner Size: 10.5""L x 9.8""W x 49.6""H | Weight: 7.6 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.8 liters | Run time: 70 minutes | Vacuum type: Cordless stick | Filter: Yes | Power: 280 watts Topping our list for best Dyson cordless stick vacuum is the Gen5detect, which has the strongest suction and longest running time of almost any stick vac we tried. How it works: Like most Dysons, the Gen5detect is made up of three main parts — a cleaner brush head, a long tube and an upper — that click into place in a matter of seconds. The upper doubles as a handheld vacuum when used with any of the included accessories. For easy emptying, the dust cup has a lever that pops it open and forcibly removes the contents. Why it's great: The Gen5detect comes with a digital ""Motorbar"" (aka ""de-tangling"" or ""vane"") brush that can be adjusted for different surfaces and materials. It also includes a special ""Fluffy Optic"" brush, designed specifically for hard surfaces, that highlights anything in its path fluorescent green for peak visibility. We felt like real-life Ghostbusters powering this thing! Because both brushes are so narrow and shallow, they got right up against baseboards and didn't miss finer materials (such as rice and sand) in our testing. And because the ""Fluffy Optic"" brush is so soft, we didn’t have to worry about scuffing up molding when using it to get into small crevices. Bonus: This brush is so nimble that we rarely needed to break out the Dyson accessory tools when navigating tighter areas, such as around dining room chairs and toilets. Additionally, the Gen5detect is the only Dyson, other than the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, to feature a power button you push on and off (other Dyson stick vacuums require you to hold down a button to keep them going). The digital screen not only displays modes and remaining run times (down to the second) but also tells you how much debris is detected and cleared from an area. Our only gripe with the Gen5detect is that, as with all Dyson cordless stick vacuums, it doesn't have headlights. That said, the ""Fluffy Optic"" brush can also work on flat rugs in a pinch.

Amazon Best canister vacuum Miele Classic C1 Turbo Team Bagged Canister Vacuum Size: 18.2""L x 11""W x 8.7""H | Weight: 13 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.95 liters | Vacuum type: Corded canister | Filter: Yes, AirClean | Power: 1,200 watts With a canister vacuum, the cleaner head, plus hose and wand, are in front, with a wheeled canister (or dust bin) trailing behind or to the side. Miele's Classic C1 Turbo is the most powerful and versatile model we tried. How it works: The Classic C1 Turbo comes with a canister containing a dust bag, a long hose, an adjustable wand and two brushes, one for hard floors and one for carpets. It also has three attachments for detailing purposes: a dusting brush, a crevice tool and an upholstery tool. Setup is easy: You just attach the hose to the canister on one side and to the wand on the other, then click the wand into whichever cleaner head base — or attachment — you'd like to use. There's a dial on the canister for selecting suction strength, along with power and cord-rewind buttons. Why it's great: The C1 Turbo managed to suck up all of the materials in our ""kitchen sink"" test, and though Miele recommends using the hard floor brush, we found the TurboTeq brush more effective with larger materials, such as Cheerios. But where this vac outpaced the competition was in our ""passenger pet"" test — when we used the TurboTeq brush, it sucked up stubborn pet hair in just a few passes. We liked how we could customize the suction settings to optimize for not only different surfaces, but different materials in varying heights. When tackling larger piles of Cheerios or sand, for example, we found the vac worked better in lower suction modes, especially in our ""carpet course."" The lower suction ensured the brush glided along the surface versus hunkering down too intensely. The adjustable pole allowed us to customize for different user heights and, when fully extended and combined with the hose, allowed for optimal reach when it came to particularly high or shallow areas. This helped when vacuuming under sofas and around kitchen chairs. In total, the vacuum offers a 29.5-foot operating radius. The attachments were effective, with the upholstery tool among our favorites for getting hair and crumbs out of sofa crevices. And despite its fairly large capacity, the canister was easy to maneuver. It glided along floors behind us and has a handle for transporting it. This vacuum boasts a three-tiered filtration system, complete with a filter bag with automatic sealing for trapping dirt and hair, a motor protection filter and a separate AirClean filter that, according to Miele, zaps up to 99.9% of airborne debris and other potential allergens. The brand also sells bagless models for those who are ready to leave the bag behind. (Read more in our guide to the best canister and upright vacuums.) Pros Customizable suction settings

Amazon Best vacuum for pet hair Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum Size: 15.5""L x 11.02""W x 42.2""H | Weight: 17.3 pounds | Bin capacity: 1.7 liters | Vacuum type: Corded upright | Filter: HEPA | Power: 290 watts When it comes to upright vacuums designed specifically for pet hair, this ""animal-style"" vacuum from Dyson is a powerful force to be reckoned with. How it works: The Dyson Ball Animal 3 comes (just about) ready to go: You just click the cleaner head, body and extendable hose/wand with handle into place to assemble. Once you're ready to vacuum (we wasted no time), you plug in the cord, choose one of three surface settings on the cleaner head base and press the red power button to operate. You can also release the hose and wand to tackle areas that are hard to reach. Why it's great: This dynamo from Dyson means serious business. Like its name suggests, it devoured Cheerios, faux fur, kitty litter, rice and other materials in our testing. Most importantly, it made matted pet fur disappear from car mats. This vacuum was so powerful that we had to hold the mats down for the highest settings. Here's where it gets really interesting: To put the Dyson Ball Animal 3 and other pet vacs to the ultimate test, I took them to my grandmother's house. Or, more precisely, I took them to her cat Caylee's nesting spot, an area of carpet with so much embedded fur that it had formed a furry veil most vacuums can barely touch. As my grandmother and I witnessed in awe, the Dyson Ball Animal 3 managed to get up every last hair. As a bonus, this vac has one of the largest dust cups of the models for pet hair we tested and the longest cord at 50 feet. It features a washable HEPA filter for greater efficacy and easier maintenance. The roller brush is anti-tangle, especially important for anyone who has a long-haired dog or cat, and the ""Extra"" version comes with additional attachments, including a tangle-free turbine tool for lifting pet hair and a grooming tool for getting right to the source of things. Of note: While the cleaner head is fairly narrow, the large swivel ball on this vacuum makes it difficult to tackle shallow areas such as under a sofa.

Amazon Best robot vacuum Narwal Freo X Ultra Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo Size: 16.3""L x 14.6""W x 17.1""H | Weight: 12.12 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.34 liters | Vacuum type: Robot with mop | Filter: Yes, sponge | Power: 150 watts | Suction rating: 8,200 Pa Prefer to take more of a hands-off approach to cleaning? Us too. A robot vac is the way to go, and this one mops your floors in addition to vacuuming them. (Note that there's a newer version of this robovac we're testing, the Freo Z10 Ultra, and we're excited to see how it compares.) How it works: The Narwal Freo X Ultra consists of a robot vacuum/mop and a stationing dock. It relies on a pair of rotating brush heads to pull debris into its path and also employs dual spinning mop heads, which are dampened and treated with detergent during startup, then cleaned and dried (with heat!) afterward. The dock serves as a one-stop shop with automatic mop washing, air drying, detergent dispensing and dust bag drying. It's designed to store up to seven weeks of dirt and is both hypoallergenic and SGS-certified. Why it's great: Though not perfect, the Narwal Freo X Ultra is the best robot house cleaner we've tested. It vacuums and mops most reliably and is least likely to require intervention. Plus, it looks really slick, its glossy all-white dock reminiscent of something you'd find in an Apple Store. We were particularly impressed by this vacuum's tangle-free brush, which remained completely clean following months of testing. It's also very clever about the way it self-empties its dustbin: It doesn't; instead, it compacts all the debris it collects. The result is a dock with room for larger water tanks, and therefore fewer trips to the sink to empty/refill. In terms of cons, the Freo X Ultra struggles to avoid cords on the floor, and its mop pads don't raise high enough to avoid dragging on medium-pile carpet. Even so, it was our favorite robo-butler to date. Pros A fast, effective cleaner

Amazon Best car vacuum Black & Decker Dustbuster Flex Cordless Handheld Vacuum Size: 14.88""L x 10.68""W x 6.5""H | Weight: 3.2 pounds | Bin capacity: 17 ounces | Vacuum type: Cordless hand vac | Filter: Yes | Power: 20 watts How it works: The vacuum comes with a charging base, plus a crevice tool, a nozzle with a flip-down brush and a pet hair tool. You toggle a switch to turn it on (it has just one cleaning mode). Why it's great: This little gadget has the power of some of the bulkier car vacuums we tested, but in a more compact body. Pebbles, crushed leaves, crumbs of all sizes and larger clumps of dirt proved no match for its powerful suction. It even picked up the Milk-Bone treats our tester's dog was secretly hoarding under the floor mat! What makes this cordless model the best car vacuum we tested: It has a flexible 4-foot hose with a curved nozzle that helps you access the tightest, most awkward spaces, like under the front seats of a car, without having to strain your back or crouch down. If you have any mobility issues, this is a huge plus. At a little over 3 pounds, the Flex Vac isn't the lightest car vac we tested, but if you hold the body by the handle in one hand and the hose in the other — or better yet, set the body down on the seat — you can maneuver it easily. The weight is also forgivable because the dust cup is so large. Expect about 15 minutes of runtime off a single charge. Of note: The battery is built into the machine (and therefore irreplaceable), so if it stops holding a charge, you're out of luck. It remains to be seen how long the battery will last (some reviews warn it's only a year or two), but we'll update this story once we do longer-term testing. Pros Small enough to fit in your trunk

Factors to consider when choosing a vacuum

Size: Bigger vacuums generally have larger dust cups and cleaner heads. Longer hoses, wands and cords equate to greater reach. Longer brush rolls mean fewer passes. Wider and dual brush rolls mean shorter passes.

Weight: The lighter the vacuum, the easier the lift (and steer). Lightweight designs glide across hardwood floors seamlessly but can mean less grip on thick carpets. Lighter models are often also associated with smaller dust cups and fewer tech components (like LCD screens and the respective engineering that makes a vacuum top-heavy), though not always. Swivel cleaner heads can help with maneuvering, especially with heavier vacuums.

Advertisement Advertisement

Bin capacity: Larger cups house more dirt so you don’t have to take as many trips to the trash can. Aside from capacity, look for a dust cup that releases forcefully with the help of a lever so you don't have to manually unclip the cup lid and pull out debris with your fingers.

Vacuum type:

Upright vacuums consist of a cleaner head, a dust cup, a hose and a wand. Dirt travels to the dust cup via the hose and the dust cup sits above the cleaner head, with the wand behind it and handle up top. Detachable hoses (and wands) can be paired with attachment tools, but canisters usually remain in place. If you don't want to have to carry an entire vacuum up the stairs, you may want a ""lift-away""-style canister, which can be detached while cleaning. Also helpful: longer cords for greater reach, plus cord-rewind options so you don't have to wrap up the cord manually.

Stick vacuums consist of a cleaner head, a long tube (a.k.a. wand) which the dirt travels through and a vacuum head upper (or ""brain"") that features power controls and any LCD screens. The upper also houses the dust cup and can typically be detached and used as a handheld vacuum with attachments. Cordless stick options allow for more freedom and flexibility when vacuuming, but require charging and, in cases of non-freestanding options, docking.

Canister vacuums (also referred to as cylinder or barrel vacuums) have a body (motor and dust cup) that sits on the floor. That body trails behind the hose, attached to a wand (held by the user) and attachment tool or cleaner head.

Filters: Vacuum filters zap pollutants and improve air quality, with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters considered the gold standard. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), HEPA filters ""theoretically remove at least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and any airborne particles with a size of 0.3 microns,"" with larger or smaller particles “trapped with even higher efficiency.” Follow instruction manuals for how and when to replace ⁠or clean filters for optimal results. Many brands like Dyson now use washable filters for cost efficiency.

Wattage: A higher wattage often correlates to greater suction power. When it comes to cordless vacuums, high-voltage batteries generally have a longer run time, so you can tackle more spaces or several jobs in one go without recharging.

Advertisement Advertisement

Brushes and attachments: Most vacuums come with a detangling-style brush roller (in many cases, customizable or auto-adjusting) that can be used for multiple floor types. Brush cleaner headlights offer more visibility in low lighting and beneath furniture, while mini roller attachments help tackle tighter spaces (such as vacuuming inside your car; they’re also great for getting stubborn pet fur from sofas). Attachment tools aid in detailing and spot-treating cushions and curtains, and crevice tools are a must for navigating ceilings and wall corners.

App-based mapping and scheduling and smart obstacle-avoidance (for robot vacuums): Got pets? Cords? Curtains? Kids? Newer, smarter vacs can avoid toys, socks, pet accidents and other items that would trip up other models. Take note that this feature sometimes relies on a camera, one that may be able to stream a live feed to your phone through your Wi-Fi. Modern machines will use smart mapping to scan your entire space, label individual rooms and allow you to create virtual ""no-go"" zones. Mapping capabilities happen in a companion app, which also allows for scheduling, spot-cleaning, smart-assistant integration and much more.

Power-hungry: The Dyson Animal 3 grips onto — and devours pet fur from — car mats in our ""passenger pet"" test. (Kristin Granero/Yahoo)

How we tested these vacuums

We set up several obstacle courses to test these vacuums against materials with varying shapes, textures and densities on different surfaces like carpet and hardwood. We also tested their respective attachments on upholstered furniture, curtains and hard-to-reach areas. Then we put the vacuums through their paces in real-life scenarios, prioritizing homes that needed a good cleaning and/or had pet inhabitants. The nitty gritty:

""Carpet course"" test: We spaced out materials — faux fur, rice, Cheerios, kitty litter and sand — across a plush carpet to see if the vacuums managed to cut through the clutter.

""Kitchen sink"" test: We poured rice and Cheerios on a hardwood kitchen floor to gauge how well the vacuums could get a grip — especially against trims and in cabinet crevices.

""Passenger pet"" test: We asked family and friends to avoid vacuuming for a week, then used car mats to collect the fur their pet companions had shed and attempted to vacuum it in pursuit of the best suction.

""Vacs gone wild"" test: We didn’t stop there! We've clocked countless hours testing vacuums in different houses and settings to assess how they rise to different occasions.

For car vacuums, we scattered a mix of soil, sand, pet hair and crushed crackers all over the back seat and floor of a compact SUV. We weighed the mixture before dumping it, then weighed the amount of debris each vacuum picked up after a set amount of time. While cleaning, we noted how easy or hard the vacuum was to maneuver and how often we had to empty the dust bin.

For robot vacuums, we let the machines loose in our homes, testing them against small and large carpets and hard-surface floors. We noted how long it took to set them up, how well they navigated obstacles and how quickly and well they cleaned.

Vacuum FAQs

What's the difference between a stick and an upright vacuum?

Stick vacuums typically consist of a handled vacuum head, complete with a battery, dust cup, control buttons, filter and sometimes a digital display screen (think of the head, or “upper,” as its central processing and operating unit). The vacuum head attaches to a thin tube, which then connects to a cleaner head with roller brush(es). The ""upper"" can be attached to various tools for handheld use.

Like many upright vacuums these days, stick vacuums are often bagless (thanks to their dust cups). They are also often cordless, whereas most upright vacuums have a cord. Given their svelte silhouettes and detachable parts, cordless stick vacuums tend to be more nimble and storage-friendly. But they may not pack as much power as an upright vacuum.

Are upright vacuums better than cylinder vacuums?

Cylinder (a.k.a. canister) vacuums are often lighter and more compact, and therefore easier to maneuver and store, than upright vacuums. As they typically have more room to support bigger motors, cylinder vacuums can also prove more powerful than uprights. The downside is that because a cylinder vacuum's body trails behind the cleaner head, it's more likely to bump into things.

How often should you vacuum?

It depends on how many people (and pets!) are in your home. As a general rule of thumb, cleaning services like Molly Maid suggest vacuuming carpeted floors twice per week, and hardwood and tile floors once a week. Pet owners should aim to do a quick maintenance vacuum daily to keep fur and dander at bay.

How do you clean a vacuum?

To ensure your vacuum remains in tip-top shape, many brands, such as Dyson, advise cleaning washable filters at least once a month with regular use. We recommend consulting your vacuum's manual for tips, including when to wash and/or replace filters and brush rollers. Look for dust cups that have levers for forcefully ejecting dirt into the trash can. And, because vacuums are often at the center of the action, wipe yours down regularly to reduce the amount of dust and dirt that can emanate.

If it feels like everyone has an air fryer but you, that's because it’s increasingly true. One in three Americans uses an air fryer at least once per week to cook food at home, according to the market research firm YouGov. And it's no wonder: Air fryers are typically healthier than deep-oil frying and speedier than conventional ovens. The best air fryers for 2025 are also extremely versatile and convenient, with snazzy presets that take the guesswork out of cooking. Their nonstick baskets and dishwasher-safe trays make for easy cleaning, better than degreasing your whole oven.



All the sizzlers on this list have been reviewed and recommended by Yahoo staffers who write about and test appliances for a living. Combined, we've evaluated more than 20 air fryers over the past two years, using them to crisp up the usual suspects, like French fries and chicken nuggets, but also more involved foods, like an entire chicken. Whether you're buying your first air fryer or are due for an upgrade, our top picks are worthy additions to your kitchen — but if you want even more options, keep scrolling for more air fryers our team has tested and approved.

Best air fryers for 2025

Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life Best air fryer overall Cuisinart 6-Quart Basket Air Fryer Oven Size: 12""D x 16.5""W x 12.25""H | Capacity: 6 quarts | Power: 1800 watts | Max temp: 450°F | Style: Single-basket | Functions: Air fry, roast, bake, broil or warm | Care: Dishwasher-safe basket and tray Best for: Medium-sized groups and foods that can withstand tossing. Topping our list is this partially stainless-steel air fryer from Cuisinart. This versatile model boasts substantial cooking room, minimal maintenance and an easy-to-master learning curve, all while looking non-clunky. (Dare we say, sleek?) How it works: The air fryer comes pre-assembled, so there's no setup required — simply ensure the inner tray is secure, plug in the device, and you're ready to go. We found the accompanying instructions to be intuitive, and a variety of recipes are included for added convenience. A bright LED interface displays five functions — air fry, roast, bake, broil, and warm — for a variety of cooking methods. Five presets take the guesswork out of foods that don't come with air-frying instructions. (The ""toss reminder"" proved handy when we tested larger batches.) Why we love it: We assessed the air fry function by making french fries, breaded chicken tenders, chicken wings and crab rangoons, using package instructions and the ""frozen"" preset where there were none. Everything came out right on time in juicy-on-the-inside, crispy-on-the-outside fashion. We were particularly impressed that the crab rangoons stayed intact, retaining all (or at least most) of their filling. While air-frying was the main focus of our test, we also tried our hands at several other functions: Our roasted chicken breasts, baked salmon and broiled steaks cooked to perfection. The air fryer handle remained cool to the touch and the basket is dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning. We also appreciated the clear panel and interior light for monitoring foods, especially helpful when we were cooking meals in low lighting (and, er, late-night snacking).

Best for: Larger foods, families and gatherings, and cooking multiple batches of food, in different ways, at once. How it works: Like some other dual-basket air fryers, the Foodi has two — in this case, 3.5-quart or up to 4-pound — baskets for separately air-frying two foods simultaneously. Unlike other dual-basket air fryers, the Foodi’s divider is flexible and can be removed to create an extra-large, 7-quart surface area (referred to as the ""MegaZone"") for cooking larger batches and proteins whenever you want. Why we love it: We tested its air-frying chops using the same frozen mix as with our other test models — breaded chicken tenders, french fries, crab rangoons and chicken wings — in different bins with different specifications. And the Foodi didn’t skip a beat: Everything came out as or even better than expected, with crispy skins and temp precision. Because the Foodi allows you to select two functions, we were able to bake our salmon and broil a steak side-by-side, cooking simultaneously and concluding at the same time. With the center insert removed, we successfully roasted an entire chicken, complete with sides, in about an hour, with only a few minutes of preheating and without heating the entire kitchen in the process. The Foodi’s display was user-friendly (and fun!) to navigate and came with removable adhesives listing suggested times and temps for common foods. The handles stayed cool, and the shell was warm, but not too hot (even after cooking a chicken for so long, we were able to pick up and carry the appliance to another spot). Each of the basket, divider and crisper plates are dishwasher-safe for easy cleanups. Pros LED display

Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life Best air fryer toaster oven combo Our Place Wonder Oven Size: 10.6""D x 11.5""W x 11.6""H | Capacity: 12 liters | Power: 1400 watts | Max temp: 450°F | Style: Dual/flex-basket | Functions: Air fry, broil, toast, roast, bake or reheat, plus steam option | Care: Trays are hand-wash only This toaster/air fryer hybrid from Our Place is an expert at multitasking, hitting the sweet spot in our testing for size, price and function. Best for: Gooey and delicate foods, and home cooks who want an appliance that also makes a design statement. How it works: It has a 12-liter capacity that supports four slices of toast, 1 pound of French fries or a 9-inch pizza, and a 4.5-pound chicken with only the bottom tray in place. It also performs six duties: air frying, baking, toasting, broiling, reheating and roasting, with the option to infuse steam, for different texture preferences and appetites. Why we love it: We tested the air fryer functionality with the usual suspects — french fries, breaded chicken tenders, chicken wings and crab rangoons — and everything came out to (tender, crispy) spec. Given the shallowness of the air fryer basket, which allows you to remove foods using a spatula with less risk of turnover, we were also able to air-fry more delicate foods like stuffed jalapeño peppers. And because the appliance comes with a crumb/drip tray, we didn't have to worry about cheese oozing onto the bottom of the oven and making a mess. To evaluate the other functions, we toasted bread, baked pizza, roasted chicken and — you guessed it — broiled up some skirt steak, switching up the nonstick, nontoxic racks and pans accordingly. We watched curiously through the big glass window on the door panel to see if each would rise to the occasion, and lo and behold, they did. The Wonder Oven's handle remained cool, and the coated oven surface got warm but not piping hot like other toasters we’ve tried. We prioritized performance in our evaluations, but we’d be remiss if we didn’t point out that this oven comes in six beautiful shades. For this price, it's not cheap, but it’s often on sale, and its versatility and the accompanying accessories add to its value. Pros Window and interior lighting for more visibility

Jessica Dodell-Feder/Yahoo Best small air fryer Ninja Crispi 4-in-1 Portable Glass Air Fryer Size: 13.38""D x 11.96""W x 13.58""H | Capacity: Up to 4 quarts | Power: 1,500 watts | Max temp: 450°F | Style: Glass | Functions: Air fry, recrisp, bake, ""max crisp"" | Care: Dishwasher-safe glass containers, lids and pod adapter When we say the Ninja Crispi is the best small air fryer, it's not because of the capacity. This gadget packs a lot of cooking power into a compact frame, about 13 inches wide and just as tall. It also nests inside its glass fryer basket when not in use, so it takes up about as much space in a cabinet as a personal blender. Compared to most of these behemoth appliances, it's a pipsqueak — and a very welcome invention if you have a small kitchen. Best for: Smaller kitchens and anyone who lives alone. How it works: Unlike most other air fryers that use a nonstick metal basket, the Ninja Crispi comes with 4-quart and 6-cup glass containers. You place a metal grate on the bottom, add your food and then place the corded ""pod"" on top; basically it's a lid that houses the heating element and controls. The machine has four functions — recrisp, bake, air fry and max crisp — that correspond to different temperature ranges. Why we love it: It does its job, and it does it well, crisping dumplings, fries and more to perfection. You can cook multiple foods in it at the same time, and even use the space under the metal grate to warm foods that don't need the fryer treatment. Ninja recommends you shake or turn most foods midway through cooking, and that's not always easy to do, as both the pod and glass containers get hot. Food can also stick to the metal grate, but overall, the Crispi is a winner, and a portable one at that! This is the kind of gadget you could bring tailgating or to a friend's house — all you need is an outlet.

Factors to consider when choosing an air fryer

Size: Compact air fryers require less counter space, therefore ideal for cozy or crowded kitchens. Bigger air fryers require more breathing room but typically house larger pieces and quantities of food for feeding families. The sizes mentioned in each write-up in this story represent the exterior dimensions of the air fryer once it is assembled, with capacities reflecting the interior baskets and tray allocations. We didn’t count air fryer baskets as accessories because they are core to an air fryer’s function.



Capacity: Lower capacities, obviously, mean smaller portions. We’d recommend at least 2 to 3 quarts of cooking room for individual servings, 4 quarts for two servings and 6 quarts or more for households of four or more (higher capacities are also helpful for entertaining).



Power: More power typically yields quicker results. Similarly, higher temperatures will allow you to zap certain foods, such as frozen pizzas and slices, at a faster rate for more of a ""brick oven"" taste. Follow food package and air fryer instructions closely, especially when getting familiar with your air fryer, as a way to learn (and not burn).



Style: Single-basket air fryers are typically the most straightforward and offer the most depth for containing bulkier, higher batches (think plump chicken tenders, thick french fries and towering nacho piles). That said, they may require you to pause and rotate foods to ensure evenness from time to time. Dual-basket air fryers aren't usually as deep as single-basket air fryers, but they allow you to cook two (still substantial) heaps of food with different specifications in separate spaces, in one go. Removable center inserts offer the flexibility to create an extra-large basket for heartier servings and roasts. Air fryer toasters can typically be stacked with trays for cooking thinner, more delicate foods in shallow rows, such as bread, bagels or hors d'oeuvres (you can use different tray types, but the temp will be the same for all). Generally speaking, toaster hybrids take longer to preheat and get hotter than traditional air fryers.

Functions: Most air fryers made today offer additional functions, such as roasting, baking, warming, reheating or dehydrating, for more versatility and convenience. The benefit of using a basket-style air fryer to roast or bake versus the oven is that it will usually do so with less preheating and in less time. In our experience, air fryer exteriors remain warm (but not nearly as hot as conventional ovens) and they don't heat the whole kitchen in warmer months.



Care: Nonstick and dishwasher-safe baskets, bins and trays make for easy cleaning when your meal is done. Be sure to follow instructions carefully, and never put electric appliances in the sink or dishwasher as a general rule of thumb.

We air-fried chicken tenders and nuggets for 10 minutes at 350ºF in three of our top picks: (from left) the Our Place Wonder Oven, the Cuisinart 6-Qt. and the Ninja 6-in-1 DualZone. As you can see, the results were very similar, with the Ninja producing a slightly crispier result. (Kristin Granero/Yahoo)

How we tested

Our testing group for this guide was made up of Yahoo editors and writers with home, tech and culinary backgrounds. We procured top-rated air fryers and used them to crisp frozen favorites like chicken tenders and french fries, also experimenting with other foods and functions to gauge how well — and how fast! — each model could deliver the (chewy-in-the-middle, crispy-on-the-outside) goods. We also considered and evaluated things like practicality (ease of setup, use and cleaning), durability (materials and design) and safety features to determine which air fryers were worthy of your precious counter space.

Air fryer FAQs

How does an air fryer work?

An air fryer works like a convection oven, circulating hot air around food. This means you don't have to worry about flipping, say, chicken nuggets, as long as they're not overlapping. The main difference between an air fryer and a convection oven is that air fryers blow air more rapidly and in a smaller space, therefore speeding up the cooking process.

How do I cook in an air fryer?

To cook in an air fryer, simply choose the temperature, time and function, and then press ""start"" (with little to no preheating). Place your food in the fryer, allowing space for the hot air to reach it from all angles. For larger portions, you may need to pause and rotate food here and there. While an air fryer doesn’t require a lot of oil like traditional frying, drizzling or spraying a light amount of cooking oil on interior baskets, trays and foods can keep items from sticking and help achieve that golden veil.

What cannot be cooked in an air fryer?

Foods that don't cook well in an air fryer include fried foods with wet batters, like beer-battered fish and corn dogs, as well as foods that require a lot of liquid, such as soups and stews. Foods with gooey fillings, such as mozzarella sticks, should be watched more closely and paired with a tray as available, to avoid overcooking (aka having them spontaneously combust) and making a mess. It's always a good idea to refer to the specific instructions for your air fryer model, as results may vary.

Stick to cooking small, slim and scattered foods for faster and crispier results. Avoid using aluminum foil or parchment paper, as they can block airflow. Some air fryers can also roast or bake, allowing the use of foil or parchment paper.

How do you clean an air fryer?

When cleaning an air fryer, as with any appliance, avoid touching hot surfaces and keep electrical components away from water. Once your device has cooled, simply hand-wash or dishwash pans and bins. When wiping down the air fryer shell and counter surface, a dry or slightly damp towel should do the trick.

Why are people getting rid of air fryers?

You may have seen articles about the potential safety risks of air fryers, including recalls by certain brands related to these appliances overheating and becoming fire hazards. While this has affected a small segment of the market, you should use all air fryers with caution. Ensure that you clean them thoroughly to prevent grease and oil from accumulating in the interior. Another reason people may get rid of their countertop air fryer is that many newer ovens and toaster ovens also have air frying functions.

2025-11-13 17:10:06+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/,"The best luggage of 2025, tested and reviewed by travel experts","You'll look put together while pulling one of these suitcases. (U.S. Traveler/Samsonite/Amazon)

Whether you're a seasoned nomad racking up the miles or an every-now-and-then traveler, your luggage isn’t just a bag for your stuff; it can be the difference between travel chaos and zen. Luggage is a lockbox, a safe haven, a wardrobe, a laundry basket and your only bit of home away from home. You want a bag that will keep your stuff safe, organized and easy to find, and the right luggage really does make all the difference.

A trusty travel bag ""oftentimes can be someone's entire life fit into a suitcase,"" says Serenity Lesley, CEO and founder of travel site Manifesting Serenity. It can ""carry memories or protect someone's possessions. As a nomad who sold almost everything and fit everything that was essential for me [into a suitcase], it houses my many elements of my life in it.""

So, when it comes to buying luggage, there's a lot at stake — and a lot to consider. We conducted extensive research and interviews to find luggage worth your money and trust. We spoke with frequent fliers, travel influencers, tour guides and our own team of shopping experts to narrow the list, examining factors like durability and ease of use as well as features such as TSA-compliant locks, on-board batteries and expandability. The result? The ultimate list of the best hard- and soft-sided luggage you'll be excited to take along on your next trip.

Amazon Best checked luggage Samsonite Omni PC Hardside Expandable Luggage Exterior dimensions: 26.5"" x 17.75"" x 11.75"" | Interior dimensions: 24"" x 17.5"" x 11.5"" | Weight: 8.34 lbs. | Capacity: Not listed | Expandable: Yes | Shell material: 100% polycarbonate | Interior pockets: 1 | Exterior pockets: 0 | TSA lock: Yes | On-board battery: None | Colors: 10 Why we love it: Made of lightweight yet extremely durable polycarbonate, this affordable checked bag comes highly recommended. We love the bright color options, including this snazzy red that'll make it stand out on the luggage carousel, saving you time and worry. What our experts say: Peter Hamdy, owner and director of New Zealand-based Auckland and Beyond Tours, says this crowd-pleasing hardshell is one of his favorite pieces because of its sleek design and spacious interior. What reviewers say: ""It holds a lot and rolls very well. I've taken it on six flights so far (filled it up to 48 pounds!) and it has held up great … no damage, no issues,"" wrote one five-star reviewer. Keep in mind: Several users say the wheels aren't as smooth as they'd hoped and that pulling the bag through the airport with a carry-on atop can be challenging. ""The concept that these are supposed to be spinner wheels is completely lost,"" said one reviewer. ""I literally give up and use them all like an old-school suitcase that only has two wheels."" Pros Durable polycarbonate design

Amazon Best carry-on luggage Away Carry-On Exterior dimensions: 21.7"" x 14.4"" x 9"" | Interior dimensions: 20.1"" x 13.9"" x 7.5"" | Weight: 7.5 lbs. | Capacity: 39.8 L | Expandable: No | Shell material: 100% polycarbonate | Interior pockets: 4 | Exterior pockets: 0 | TSA lock: Yes | On-board battery: None | Colors: 8 Why we love it: Away is a standout luggage brand, and this ubiquitous wheeled carry-on is no exception. When we polled our team of experts for their favorite carry-on bag, this was by far the most popular. Its popularity means it's common at the airport, so we love that you can get it personalized with your initials (for an extra fee) to avoid mixups at the luggage carousel. What our experts say: Director of Commerce Initiatives Jeanine Edwards has traveled with this small suitcase for over five years and raves about the wheels. ""They turn in all directions like a dream and work just as well on carpet as they do on hard floors,"" she says. Meanwhile, Senior Deals Writer Carrie McCabe loves that it includes a built-in combination lock and says it's the ideal size for most airline overhead storage, so there are ""no worries about last-minute bag checks."" (We confirmed this in our research: the smallest overhead bin size limit is 22"" x 14"" x 9"".) Senior Commerce Editor Rory Halperin is a fan of the bag's interior compression system. “It's incredible how much you can pack in,” she says. What reviewers say: ""The wheels are strong, durable and glide easily over any type of surface,"" said one shopper. ""The case itself is lightweight, and that really matters when you're packing for airplane travel. I'm also amazed at how much I can fit inside, thanks to the compression pad."" Keep in mind: While Away was once well known for having built-in chargers, it no longer includes batteries in its luggage. This model also doesn't offer any expansion and lacks external pockets, so you'll have to pack carefully. Pros Durable polycarbonate design

It's lightweight, roomy and affordable — hard to go wrong. What our experts say: Despite it being fairly basic, it's one of travel blogger Serenity Lesley's go-to suitcases because it's so spacious. Along with the two roomy main compartments and four spinner wheels, she appreciates that the bag features a retractable handle, as well as top and side handles that allow for maximum maneuverability. What reviewers say: ""Great luggage. Good color and design. Rolls very well. Lightweight with awesome capacity,"" said one thrifty traveler. ""We went on a trip and took our toddler and we were able to fit everything we needed and then some."" Keep in mind: It's not the most durable luggage out there. One reviewer said its light weight comes at the cost of ""making the shell material super thin [and] flexible."" It could dent or even crack, so while it's great for packing huge loads, it may not be great for standing up to rough baggage handlers for an extended time. Pros Affordable

What our experts say: I love the fact that this luggage comes in so many variations, from carry-on to large checked or even a three-piece set, all at a budget-friendly price. It's among the lightest luggage on our list (it's one of the suitcases not made of polycarbonate) yet is still expandable, which can be rare for hardshell bags. What reviewers say: ""Definitely a solid pick for the price. Honestly, the hardshell feels really durable it looks like it can take a beating from the baggage handlers,"" said a fan. ""But the best part has to be the wheels; they roll super smooth, making it a breeze to pull these through a busy airport."" Keep in mind: Buyers say that while this luggage is affordable initially, it may not last forever. ""I have traveled quite a bit with this suitcase,"" said a realistic reviewer. ""It has never failed me, though it is clear that it will soon and must be replaced. It is considerably cheaper than other suitcases and I suppose you get what you pay for."" Pros Affordable

It has that softshell flex that lets you cram in just a few more souvenirs while still clocking in under the maximum size for checked luggage (62 linear inches) — plus 2 inches of expandability, if you could possibly need more. What our experts say: This is one of Hamdy's top picks because it's a no-nonsense case that doesn't have a lock or battery but fits everything you'll need and then some. He likes the contour of the ergonomically designed handle, which makes it easier to lift even when full to the brim. The polyester outer is treated with a weatherproof finish, too, so while it's not as weatherproof as hard side luggage, it can stand up to some elements. What reviewers say: ""I put mine through a LOT this year on two complex global itineraries,"" said one reviewer. ""It doesn't show any damage of any kind, still rolls beautifully, and was never any source of frustration [and] is amazingly light."" Keep in mind: The trade-off for its lightness is durability that leaves something to be desired for some reviewers. ""The material, while light, felt a bit too flexible for my liking,"" said one buyer. ""It's great for keeping weight down, but it didn’t offer much structure or protection for items inside. It also didn't feel as durable as I'd hoped for something at this price point, especially for frequent travel."" Pros Largest capacity available

This under-seat model is an editor favorite and can be wheeled or carried for easy travel anywhere — even under an airplane seat, amazingly. What our experts say: I'm someone who hasn't checked luggage in years, thanks in part to this piece that I've had for nearly a decade (and still reach for on overnight or weekend trips). I love using it instead of a classic weekender bag — it fits the same amount while saving my shoulders and back, and the thoughtful compartments eliminate the need for additional toiletry bags or even packing cubes. What reviewers say: ""Thoughtfully placed compartments and mildly surprising capacity to complement a three-day business trip,"" said one traveler. ""Bag fit neatly under the seat with space for my feet."" Keep in mind: Although this bag has a laptop compartment, some reviewers were frustrated with the fact it can only hold up to a 13-inch device. ""It has an attached laptop sleeve in the main compartment that's too small to hold most laptops and it can't be removed,"" said one. Pros Durable

There's a space for everything. What our experts say: ""It's super spacious and comes with integrated pockets and a packing cube that doubles as a compression system,"" says travel influencer Catarina Mello. ""Plus, the hardshell is tough and scratch-resistant, and the wheels are very high quality — the bag rolls smoothly even when packed to the brim."" It also has an expansion zipper that allows more capacity if you need it, rare on hardshell models. What reviewers say: It ""makes traveling easy with so many compartments inside and out,"" said one. ""It's the perfect size, very chic and durable."" Another added, ""The interior layout is a traveler's dream. I've managed to pack enough clothes for a five-day business trip, including a couple of suits that stayed surprisingly wrinkle-free thanks to the compression straps. The separate compartments have really helped me stay organized — no more digging around for my laptop or toiletries during security checks."" Keep in mind: At over $400, this bag is a serious investment, and some reviewers say the value isn't quite worth the high sticker price.

It rolls smoothly and has a reputation for better durability compared with some of its similarly priced counterparts. What our experts say: Hamdy recommends this checked bag because it ""offers a combination of durability, functionality and style"" at a reasonable price. It's a tad heavier than some of the other hard cases on our list, but the tradeoff is toughness. What reviewers say: Shoppers say the polycarbonate hardshell is extremely durable, even after getting knocked around beneath a plane's luggage hold. They love how much stuff this suitcase can hold too: One reviewer called it ""massive,"" before adding, ""It swallows up 3-4 weeks of travel needs, including multiple pairs of shoes for all kinds of adventures and big fluffy snow clothes."" Keep in mind: It's a bit heavy, and some reviewers had middling experiences with the wheels, reporting that they seemed to roll less smoothly than previous Delsey luggage they'd owned.

How we chose the best luggage

Our team of product reviewing experts conducted hours of research, including vetting user reviews, Reddit and retailer sites, and interviewed leading travel experts to find the best luggage on the market. We polled digital nomads, travel influencers, tour guides, frequent fliers, over-packers and carry-on loyalists alike.

Advertisement Advertisement

And of course, we relied on our own expertise, leaning on our decades of expertise reviewing travel accessories like luggage. I, for example, tend to net 100-plus travel days a year and have had periodic stints living out of a backpack for months on end. Generally, I live out of luggage more often than I live in my apartment, so I know a lot about what makes a good bag (and a bad one).

When it came to narrowing down our list, we did an initial market analysis to determine which brands, models and styles are the most reliable and trusted. Then, we considered attributes like performance (from wheels to handles to weight), durability and longevity (e.g. does it hold up to repeated use or show signs of wear quickly? How often does it need to be replaced?).

We looked at ease of use and how easy it is to pack, lift, wheel and store, and considered additional features like TSA locks, on-board batteries, expandability and organization. The final result? A tightly curated list of the luggage we would buy tomorrow — or already have.

Factors to consider when choosing luggage

✓ Size: First and foremost, ""the size should align with your travel needs and airline restrictions,"" said Ritesh Raj, COO of travel website CuddlyNest. And you'll want to make your selection based on the length of your most common trips, suggested Catarina Mello, travel creator at Professional Traveler.

Advertisement Advertisement

""Carry-ons are perfect for quick weekend trips,"" Mello said. To be safe, we recommend a carry-on size of 22"" x 14"" x 9""; some airlines allow for larger, but just in case, that size will get you furthest with the least headache. That's especially true ""if you're planning robust international travel, particularly in Europe or on smaller airplanes, you want to consider a smaller carry-on than you may be used to in the U.S.,"" said Jack and Sharon Benoff, owners of boutique travel agency Vacationeeze.

""Medium luggage is a good option for trips that are a week or two,"" Mello added. If you're flying, these sized bags will have to be checked.

""A large suitcase is ideal for longer trips or trips to cold destinations where you might have to pack heavy jackets, thick layers and bulky shoes,"" Mello said. If you're checking luggage, keep in mind that the maximum checked luggage size is 62 linear inches (the sum of the length, width and depth) for most airlines.

✓ Weight: Pay attention to how much the piece of luggage weighs, especially when it comes to checked bags, which generally have to be under 50 pounds fully packed. You may be able to get away with a heavy carry-on, so long as it fits in the overhead — just be sure you can lift it and remove it from the overhead cabin. A lighter suitcase will allow you to add more of your belongings, though that may also indicate less durability.

✓ Durability: ""Durability is crucial for withstanding rough handling during transit,"" Raj says. Prioritize durable, crush-resistant materials and strong construction. Our recommendation? Polycarbonate. It's highly durable and lightweight, and it offers protection against the elements too.

✓ Maneuverability. ""Maneuverability, determined by factors like wheel quality, can greatly impact your travel comfort,"" Raj says. Spinner wheels (at least four of them) tend to make for the smoothest ride. ""While two-wheel options might be more durable, spinner wheels make them easier to maneuver,"" added Sonni Hood, public relations and community relations manager at Unclaimed Baggage. Also keep in mind the comfort and adjustability of the handles (both telescopic and side helper handles).

✓ Shape: Hood says another consideration should be the shape of the bag — you want to choose one that ""maximizes packing space and fits comfortably in storage areas."" Squared edges and flat sides tend to be best.

Features to consider when choosing luggage

Suitcases aren't just empty vessels to hold your belongings. Most bags have special features that add even more value and make travel days more convenient and stress-free.

Advertisement Advertisement

✓ Built-in battery: Hamdy recommends looking for options that have built-in charging ports to keep your devices fully juiced during transit or at the airport. Just double check that the battery is carry-on compliant: According to TSA, lithium metal (non-rechargeable) batteries are limited to 2 grams of lithium per battery, while lithium ion (rechargeable) batteries are limited to a rating of 100 watt hours (Wh) per battery.

And if your carry-on is gate-checked, you’ll need to be able to quickly remove the battery since lithium batteries and power banks must travel in the cabin, per the FAA, so be sure the battery is in an easy-to-access compartment with a simple eject button.

✓ Expansion capability: Fiona Spinks, travel expert and founder of Following Fiona, told us that she's a fan of bags with expandable zippers. Most of the expandable bags on our list grow up to 2 inches to make room when you need it. You can also use this expansion feature to compress an overpacked bag — just be sure the expanded measurements still fit the overhead bin restrictions if you're traveling by plane.

✓ Organizational features: Spinks recommends choosing bag options with multiple compartments and pockets to make organizing your stuff a much easier process. ""Personally, nothing stresses me out like rummaging for my passport at security!"" she said. If that sounds like you, you may want a suitcase with a handy exterior pocket that grants easy access to important or high-touch belongings. Hamdy also likes luggage that comes with removable laundry bags to keep your clean and dirty clothes separated during travel.

Material: Hard-side vs. soft-side

As for the age-old question of hardshell vs. softshell suitcases, there are pros and cons for both options.

Hardshell Softshell Pros ✓ Durable ✓ Tough exterior ✓ Weatherproof ✓ Built-in locks and charging ports ✓ Fits more ✓ Lighter weight ✓ Hides dents and scratches ✓ Exterior pockets Cons ✓ Quickly show signs of wear and damage ✓ Often lack exterior compartments ✓ Heavier weight ✓ Fits less ✓ Less durable ✓ Not water-resistant ✓ May tear ✓ Fewer bells and whistles

""If you tend to overpack, softshell luggage may allow you to shove a few extra pieces in, but you run the risk of an overweight or too large suitcase,"" says Victor Tam, co-founder and CEO of luggage brand Monos.

Advertisement Advertisement

Brad Foley, travel blogger at Foley Exploring says, ""no question ... softshell is better. Particularly for international travel."" Why? Aside from being more flexible and versatile, softshell bags are also ""generally lighter than hardshell, allowing you to maximize your baggage weight with more belongings."" Plus, they don’t show dents and scratches — maintaining a better aesthetic appearance, and most ""come with exterior pockets, offering convenient storage for items you may need quick access to,"" he adds.

On the other hand, ""Hardshell luggage weighs more, but it is far more durable and has a tough exterior, which will offer more protection, keeping your things safe,"" said Meg Jerrard, travel writer at Solo Female Travelers. ""It's a far better choice if you want something that's easy to move around, and if you're traveling with breakables or valuables. Hardshell suitcases particularly come in handy if you get caught in the rain or snow, as they are much more weatherproof than softshell options, giving your stuff protection from getting wet."" Foley also likes that hardshell bags ""often come with built-in locks, providing an additional layer of security for your belongings,"" though some soft-sided suitcases feature locks as well.

Best luggage FAQs

How long should a piece of luggage last?

It depends on how often you travel, how you travel and how you (and others) treat your bag, but in general, experts say a quality piece of luggage should last anywhere between three and 10 years.

All experts agreed that the more you spend on a high-quality piece, the longer you’ll have it, a sentiment echoed by user reviews in our research. ""It's best to invest in durable materials and robust construction,"" said Viola Sender, co-owner of travel blog Away to the City. ""And with regular maintenance, like checking and replacing wheels, you can prolong its lifespan.""

When is it time to replace my luggage?

Summer Hull, director of content at The Points Guy, recommends not giving up on a suitcase or weekender just because it gets scratched or looks a little worse for wear. ""Most luggage will lose some rolling smoothness over time, but my advice is to keep using it until it just doesn't roll very well anymore, to the point it is causing you trouble — or has some other issue that renders it less useful,” she says. ""I have one Rimowa bag that I've used for over a decade that's flown almost half a million miles – it's not as smooth as it once was but it can still do the job.""

What's the best luggage for international travel?

Your choice of a checked suitcase really ""depends on the type of trip, the frequency that you'll be moving from place to place, and what type of transportation you'll be taking,” says Lindsay Stevens, travel content creator at Lindzoutside. ""I don't believe having different luggage for international and domestic travel is necessary, but I do recommend having different luggage for different types of travel. I have different luggage for lightweight travel, adventure travel, and more maximalist travel where I allow myself to pack more outfits.""

Advertisement Advertisement

While size requirements can vary by airline, the typical recommended carry-on suitcase size for domestic flights is 22"" x 14"" x 9"" and the internationally recommended carry-on size is 21.5"" x 15.5"" x 9"". ""While a 21-inch is fine for many European airlines nowadays, a 20-inch or even 19-inch is sometimes a wise choice,"" especially if you want to avoid having to gate check or pay extra fees, said Jeannie Mak, managing editor at Travel Fashion Girl.

How can I avoid losing my luggage?

Choose a bag that stands out . ""Unique or colorful bags are less likely to be mistakenly taken by another traveler, reducing the risk of mix-ups,"" Hood says.

""Attach unique identifiers such as a distinct luggage tag, belts or ribbons,"" Hood adds.

Always make sure your bags are properly labeled, even if you don't plan on checking them. ""The No. 1 reason a bag goes permanently lost is due to lack of identification. Ensure a luggage tag is included on your suitcase with up-to-date contact information including your name, phone number and email address. Label the inside of the luggage as well. This can be useful if the external tag becomes detached,"" Hood says.

Stash an AirTag or tracker inside your luggage. As someone who's left my suitcase in the back of taxis and had a bag go ""permanently missing in Canada,"" my AirTag has helped me locate my bag faster than any airline customer service department ever has.

2025-11-18 16:23:49+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/,"The 14 best pairs of jeans, according to style editors and shopping experts who've tried them all","We've tried on countless pairs of jeans, so you don't have to.

Hunting for jeans has got to be my most-dreaded shopping activity. Finding a well-fitting, comfortable and flattering pair can truly feel like an impossibility: The sizing is inconsistent from brand to brand (and often between styles and washes within the same brand). How is it possible that the waist gaps and pinches simultaneously? And of course, you want your tush to look great — it's a tall order. So when I find a pair that fits, and I mean really fits, I can practically hear angels singing above.

That said, every single body is so, so different. Yes, I'm a style editor, and yes, I could sit here all day and rattle off the brands, cuts and styles I've come to swear by — but I'm just one person with one body type and one (highly specific bordering on obnoxious) set of preferences. That's why I enlisted my fellow Yahoo Shopping editors, a crew that’s collectively tried on a lot of denim in the name of research — we're talking hundreds of pairs over a combined century, at least. Suffice it to say, we have a lot of opinions.

Our team has a diverse range of body types and ages that span generations. We have varied style preferences and goals — some prefer loose-fitting, low-slung denim while others want buttery-soft denim blends that feel like sweatpants. We combined all of this unique experience to find the best jeans brands and styles.

Update, Nov. 18, 2025: We refreshed our picks based on updated testing and editor input, including styles from J.Crew, Abercrombie & Fitch, Old Navy, Levi's and more.

Old Navy Best value Old Navy High-Waisted OG Loose Jeans Material: 87% cotton, 12% polyester, 1% spandex | Sizes: 00-30 | Washes: 12 | Inseams: Petite, regular, tall Why we love them: There are no other pants in my overstuffed closet that net me more compliments than this budget-friendly Old Navy pair. They're billed as high-rise but I find them to be a true mid-rise, hitting right below the belly button without cutting off at the tummy. They're fitted through the hips and tush (and make both look good), and they go straight down without flaring or bunching. I'm 5'7"" and the regular inseam is absolutely perfect; they barely skim the floor when I'm in flats. But don't you dare think about drying them; you'll lose at least an inch off the hem. I have them in two colors and if I had more closet space, would buy more. $40 at Old Navy

Levi's Best curvy Levi's Women's 501 Curve Jeans Material: 99% Cotton, 1% Lycra | Sizes: 23-34 | Washes: 5 | Inseams: 28"", 30"", 32"", 34"" | Leg: Straight | Rise: High Why we love them: ""I’ve been on an obsessive denim journey the past few months, trying and returning more pairs of jeans than I’d like to admit,"" said Editorial Manager Zainab Akande. ""At this point, you could say I’ve earned a PhD in jeans. So I mean it when I say — if waist gaps are your mortal enemy or if you want a pair of jeans that are more forgiving around the hips and thighs, pick up a pair of Levi's 501 Curve Women's Jeans. I find them comfortable, ridiculously flattering for my curves, already own three pairs and plan on going back for more!"" $56 at Amazon

Universal Standard Best stretchy Universal Standard Donna High Rise Curve Straight Leg Jeans Material: 64% Cotton, 24% Polyester, 10.5% Rayon, 1.5% Elastane | Sizes: 23-34 | Washes: 4 | Inseams: 32"" | Leg: Straight | Rise: High Why we love them: ""I’ve had these jeans for about a year now, and they’ve become my go-to when I want to feel comfortable but still look more polished than I do in joggers or leggings,"" said Lauren Matthews-Ide, Director. ""They’ve got just the right amount of stretch to move with you, yet they hold their shape pretty well after multiple wears. They do run large, so I recommend sizing down one from your usual fit. For reference, I’m 5'7"" and wear the 'long' length, which hits perfectly at the ankle with sneakers. My only gripe is that the hems tend to curl a bit after drying, so you have to iron them if you want them to lie flat. The care tag says to air-dry, but I always toss mine in the dryer — so, maybe that's why!"" $138 at Universal Standard

Zara Best mom jeans Zara High-Waisted Mom Jeans Material: 100% cotton | Sizes: 25-32 | Washes: 3 | Inseams: Not listed Why we love them: My go-everywhere, wear-everyday, always-feel-good jeans. They're budget-friendly with a sky-high waist that sits just below the ribs, which cinches in at the tiniest part of my waist without squeezing so they look waist-whittling, not uncomfy. They have a loose, straight leg that tapers in slightly toward the ankle, and while the inseam length isn't listed, I'd say these are about 7/8 length (I'm 5'7"" and they hit right at the ankle). They're 100% cotton so they do stretch out a bit during wear, but they snap back after a spin in the dryer. $50 at Zara

J.Crew Best straight-leg J.Crew Nipped Straight Jeans Material: 99% Cotton, 1% elastane | Sizes: 23-37 | Washes: 6 | Inseams: Petite, classic, tall Leg: Straight | Rise: High Why we love them: ""J.Crew is one of my go-tos for jeans that are as comfy as they are stylish,"" says Senior Writer Kristin Granero. ""This jean in particular (in Reagan Wash) is, in my opinion, the perfect all-season fade, with a slightly-slouchy-yet-still-polished fit that I've found goes with most occasions. I wear them with a blazer to work, with sneakers to run errands, with flats to brunch and with heels at night or on the weekends."" $90 at J.Crew

J.Crew Best wide(ish) leg Full-length Slim-wide Jeans Material: 99% Cotton, 1% elastane | Sizes: 23-37 | Washes: 3 | Inseams: Petite, classic, tall | Leg: Wide | Rise: High Why we love them: ""I don't know why more people don't talk about J.Crew's jeans,"" said Director Jeanine Edwards. ""They are so great. I own over 30 pairs of jeans, and 80% of the time I reach for a pair from J.Crew because they fit so well, the quality is top-notch and most styles look good with sneakers, flats and booties. I also find the sizing really consistent, which I appreciate as an avid online shopper."" She loves this style (like, owns them in three washes loves them) since ""the slightly full leg of these jeans feels modern and fresh, but I also don't feel like I'm cosplaying as a Gen Z'er when I wear them."" $90 at J.Crew

Hudson Best bootcut Hudson Barbara High Rise Bootcut Jeans Material: 57% Cotton, 37% Modal, 4% Elastomultiester, 2% Elastane | Sizes: 23-34 | Washes: 11 | Inseams: 34.5"" | Leg: Boot | Rise: High Why we love them: ""I am not embarrassed to admit that I have about 25 pairs of jeans in my closet, because I wear a pair of denim almost every single day,"" says Editor Julia Webb. ""They are, without a doubt, my favorite piece of clothing, but it actually wasn't too hard to pick a favorite pair. Hudson's Barbara Bootcut Jeans are my go-to and the pair I always get complimented on. They hug my waist and thighs before flaring out below the knee, making my legs look miles long. They are pricey at $195, but I swear they're worth every penny."" $195 at Amazon

Abercrombie & Fitch Best low-rise Abercrombie & Fitch Low Rise Baggy Jeans Material: 99% Cotton, 1% elastane | Sizes: 23-37 | Washes: 9 | Inseams: Extra short, short, regular, long, extra long | Leg: Straight | Rise: Low Why we love them: ""If I could only wear these pants every day, I would,"" said Editor Elizabeth Berry, whose love for these jeans eclipsed her loyalty to another name-brand denim company she worked at for four years. She says they're still in great shape after a year of wear: ""They haven’t stretched out a considerable amount and feel more comfortable with each wear. My only gripe is that I got the Long version and there often isn’t inventory in my size."" $110 at Abercrombie & Fitch

Gap Best mid-rise Gap Mid Rise Relaxed Straight Jeans Material: 100% cotton | Sizes: 24-36 | Washes: 3 | Inseams: Short, regular, tall | Leg: Straight | Rise: Mid Why we love them: ""These are my 'old faithful' jeans — I've had them for years but they look and feel like the day I got them,"" said Editor Saundra Latham. ""I might also call them my Goldilocks jeans because they're not too tight and not too loose, which means they've pretty much always been in style and always will be. They're 100% cotton (i.e. no stretch) so you do have to nail your size, but that also means they don't get stretched out and baggy as the day goes on (a personal pet peeve)."" $80 at Gap

Amazon Best high-waist Levi's Women's Premium Ribcage Straight Ankle Jeans Material: 99% cotton, 1% Lycra | Sizes: 23-34 | Washes: 10 | Inseams: 27"", 29"", 31"" | Leg: Straight | Rise: High Why we love them: It doesn’t get much more classic than these high-rise, straight-leg jeans by Levi's. ""They're the perfect wide-but-not-too wide shape, and the high rise is very flattering,"" says Senior Editor Jessica Dodell-Feder, who's sworn by these for more than two years. ""They have very minimal, if any, stretch and hit at the perfect spot on my ankle bone (a feat, considering I'm 5'3""). She says they are surprisingly comfortable despite having a structured fit, ""probably because of the wide-legged fit."" $98 at Amazon

Levi's Best relaxed Levi's 94 Baggy Jeans Material: 100% cotton | Sizes: 23-34 | Washes: 11 | Inseams: 31"" | Leg: Straight | Rise: Mid Why we love them: ""I'm all about a baggy silhouette, and these vintage-style jeans are the perfect amount of baggy for me,"" said Editor Kris Scott, who says she's been living in these jeans and likes how they've loosened up a bit over wears. ""I also love the Goldilocks weight of the denim — not too thin, not too heavy, but very soft and comfy. I'm nearly 5'7"", and I love that I can give them a little cuff if I want to show off cute socks or just give them a slightly different look. And finally, as someone with a healthy-sized booty, I can report I like the way my butt looks in them too."" $49 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $56 at Zappos$60 at Nordstrom Rack

Spanx Best smoothing SpanxShape EveryWear Kick Flare Jeans Material: 87% cotton, 11% polyester, 2% elastane | Sizes: XS-3X | Washes: 5 | Inseams: Petite, regular, tall | Leg: Kick flare | Rise: High Why we love them: Former Yahoo editor Karisa Langlo found a gem in these clever Spanx jeans. With built-in shapewear technology, they hug your curves just right, making them fit ""like a glove — everywhere."" They’re made from a super stretchy, compressive fabric that fit ""very tight and holding you firmly,"" thanks to the smoothing panel across the hips. They're actually pull-ons, but you'd never know with the realizstic faux fly, belt loops and real pockets. $79 at Spanx

Abercrombie & Fitch Best petite Abercrombie & Fitch Curve Love Ultra High Rise '90s Straight Jeans Material: 99% Cotton, 1% elastane | Sizes: 23-37 | Washes: 8 | Inseams: Extra-short, short, regular, long, extra-long | Leg: Straight | Rise: High Why we love them: It's rare to find jeans that come not only in short inseams, but extra-short, too. Senior Writer Britt Ross, who is five feet tall, loves how Abercrombie’s short-length jeans hug her curvy shape without being too long. ""I opt for these when I want a more fitted look, and because I often have to contend with gapping at the waist, I appreciate that they come in a 'Curve Love' style that eliminates it,"" she says. ""They're 99% cotton and just a tad stretchy (I prefer more structured denim), and the ""Short"" length is a swell fit for my five-foot-tall frame."" Ross really appreciates that the leg area is slightly wider, as it adds comfort and makes styling a breeze. $90 at Abercrombie & Fitch",[]

The right bra forms the foundation of a confident, comfortable fit for your entire wardrobe. And yet finding a good bra can feel like the most impossible style task out there. A good fit means it supports your breasts and gives the lift you want with straps that don't slip and a band that doesn't pinch, ride up or dig in — a feat.

But whether your preference is the easy comfort of a bralette, the structure of an underwire with soft cups or something in between, there is a bra out there for you. To make your search easier, we consulted professional bra fitters and lingerie designers; we also relied on our own testing by seasoned shopping editors to identify the best bras across a range of categories.

With their expert guidance in hand, we researched and reviewed more than 50 highly rated bras in various styles and at a range of prices, narrowing down the list to determine which are truly worth your money. Whether you're seeking a wireless bra that feels like a second skin, a supportive bra for larger busts or a cute strapless style that actually stays put, you'll find a standout option here.

Update, Nov. 24, 2025: We reviewed all product prices and availability, and after additional testing, added new top picks from Cuup, Pepper, Wacoal and Evelyn & Bobbie.

Amazon Best t-shirt bra Natori Women's Plunge Fabric: 84% nylon, 16% spandex | Sizes: 30A-38DDD | Colors: 6 | Style: T-shirt | Coverage: Plunge Why we love it: While I typically try to avoid underwire bras, I barely noticed the wires in this style. I love the plunging neckline, and while I was worried the lace would show underneath my clothes, it was unnoticeable. Even better, the width of the straps increases as the sizes go up to give larger busts the support they need. What experts say: In choosing the right bra, ""you want something that is well-sewn. You want it to be even and reinforced at the straps and back,"" says Elisabeth Dale, author of The Bra Zone and founder of The Breast Life. This gorgeous bra from Natori ticks those boxes and more. The partially lined bra has a feminine lace trim that gives it a more fashion-forward feel, contoured plunge cups that give my bust a flattering shape and boost, and elastic-lined edges that keep the bra securely in place without digging. How it fits: ""It runs a bit small,"" says Senior Style Editor Jessica Teich, who has a larger cup size, and reviewers tend to agree. Still, it gives a great shape. I was skeptical that the pretty lace option would provide the all-day comfort and support I expect from a T-shirt bra, but I was shocked by just how comfy it was. It is the epitome of fashion meets function. The adjustable straps were thin yet sturdy, and while I thought the lace and mesh might get itchy or uncomfortable, they were soft and comfortable even after hours of wear. Keep in mind: ""While size options for this bra are extremely inclusive (it's rare to have a bra offer a small band/large cup combo!), it may be best-suited for smaller cup sizes,"" says Teich, who added, ""the cups run a bit small and created a double-boob beneath tighter shirts, and I had some issues with the straps slipping throughout the day. Still, it's a well-made option with thoughtful details and luxe fabric that many love."" Pros Wide range of inclusive sizing

Wider straps on larger sizes

Elastic-lined edges to keep the bra in place Cons Runs slightly small $68 at Amazon

Lively Best affordable bra Lively All-Day Deep V No-Wire Fabric: 77% nylon, 23% spandex | Sizes: 32A-38DDD | Colors: 3 | Style: Lounge | Coverage: Plunge Why we love it: This bra stays nice and comfortable, thanks to its wire-free design, but it can also be worn with practically everything, thanks to its plunging V-neck silhouette. What experts say: I love the super-soft modal fabric, and the breathable mesh wings helped keep me cool. The straps are adjustable from the front instead of the back, which makes it incredibly easy to fix the length, and a J-hook at the back lets me convert it into a racerback instantly. How it fits: I tried it with a variety of tops with different necklines and backs, and the J-hook and plunging neckline made this bra invisible underneath all of them. Keep in mind: The bra doesn't have an underwire, but the band is a bit longer down the waist than a normal bra to offer additional support. Reviewers the band sizes run a bit small, so size up if you're between sizes. We also wish there was a more inclusive size range. Pros Under $10

Comfortable wireless design

Thick, supportive band for added lift

Converts into a racerback bra Cons Comes in limited band sizes, colors $9 at Lively

Evelyn & Bobbie Best wireless bra Evelyn & Bobbie Starlette Plunge Bra Fabric: 70% polyamide, 30% elastane | Size range: XS-3XL | Colors: 7 | Style: Wireless | Coverage: Plunge Why we love it: Comfort-first bras can sometimes lack support, shape and style, but that's not the case with this ultra-comfortable option. ""It's unbelievably lightweight — you truly might forget it's on — but it still manages to deliver real support,"" says Contributing Writer and bra expert Brigitt Earley. What experts say: Helena Kaylin, founder and CEO of MINDD, the first exclusive D+ bra company, praises the brand for being ""the first to offer this seamless, smoothing solution. The plunge bra encapsulates the same comfort and support this brand is known for."" How it fits: ""I've worn this bra in heavy rotation for more than two years, and it holds up exceptionally well,"" says Earley, who loves that the band feels secure without digging or restricting movement. The brand claims the bra is designed to feel snug at first but will gently mold to your shape after a few wears for the perfect fit. The cups are removable and ""keep their shape, and the supportive sides make the underarm area look surprisingly smooth in T-shirts."" Keep in mind: Earley says the straps are a bit too wide for tank tops, but loves this bra beneath more substantial tops. Pros Removable cups for a custom fit

Offers lift without sacrificing support and comfort

Very soft fabric Cons Straps may be too thick for some tank tops $98 at Evelyn & Bobbie

Pepper Best bra for small breasts Pepper Classic All You Bra Fabric: 75% polyamide, 25% elastane | Sizes: 30A-42B | Colors: 3 | Style: T-shirt | Coverage: Plunge Why we love it: ""Specifically designed for AA–B cups, Pepper has basically become the brand for small-chested people who are tired of cups that gap, pucker or swallow your boobs whole,"" Earley says. What experts say: ""The Pepper Classic All You Bra is an underwire everyday T-shirt bra designed specifically for AA–B cups, with shallower cups that are meant to sit flush instead of gapping,"" says Earley. ""It’s lightly lined (but not push-up), has a plunging neckline, and is made of a smooth polyamide-elastane fabric that disappears under most tops."" How it fits: Earley says the bra fits true to size, with the gore sitting ""flush against the breastbone"" with light support, minimal lift and a buttery band fabric that feels great against skin all day. The ""mesh overlay looks sleek under most tops,"" she says, but ""shifts a little as you move, and because the fabric is delicate, it seems like it might stretch out over time."" Keep in mind: ""The two-layer construction can shift a bit, making it slightly noticeable under some tops,"" Earley warns. The sizing is also limited; this bra isn't available in any cup size larger than a B. Pros Specifically designed for smaller cup sizes

Shallow cups help prevent gapping

Fits true to size Cons May be noticeable under thinner fabric $47 at Pepper

Amazon Best bra for large breasts Wacoal La Femme Contour Bra Material: 84% nylon, 16% spandex | Sizes: 30B-40H | Colors: 3 | Style: T-shirt | Coverage: Demi Why we love it: Designed with large cup sizes in mind, this bra is a longtime favorite of Teich's. ""Tried and true, it's basically the only bra I wear. I've been repurchasing it since 2012,"" she says. What experts say: ""I have a large cup size and a small band size; it's difficult to find my bra size in general, let alone one that fits comfortably and lifts without digging in or hurting my shoulders or back. This bra somehow does all that and more while being more comfortable than any loungewear bra I've tried (seriously!). It's also the only — yes, the only ever — bra I've worn where the shoulder straps don't slip off or dig in,"" she says. How it fits: ""It's one of the rare bras that fits true to size: No spill-over, no pinching, no weird gaping,"" says Teich. ""Best of all, it's truly comfortable; more comfortable than any bralette, wireless or even sports bra. It doesn't dig at my ribs or shoulders, it barely leaves a mark on my skin around the back, yet it keeps my breasts separated and lifted."" She says it's somewhere between demi and full coverage, but it stays invisible beneath lower-cut tank tops and thin T-shirts with substantially lined (but not padded) cups to prevent show-through. Keep in mind: ""The shoulder straps are made of a silky material, so the plastic adjustments can slip over multiple wears and make the shoulder straps less supportive,"" Teich warns. ""I just readjust them after every wash."" She adds: ""I don't love that the lining is polyester, which pills and collects lint over time."" This bra is also not available in cup sizes lower than a B. Pros Comfortable, flattering fit for larger breasts

Straps and band are supportive without digging

Long-lasting, durable construction Cons Shoulder-strap adjustments can slip over time $68 at Amazon

Amazon Best bra for extended sizes Cuup The Full Coverage Mesh Material: 75% nylon, 25% spandex | Sizes: 30A-50H | Colors: 3 | Style: T-shirt | Coverage: Full scoop Why we love it: ""I've never seen another bra brand with more inclusive sizing than Cuup,"" says Teich. ""With options from 30A-50H, there's no shortage of availability for band and cup sizes."" I tested another Cuup style and loved how the cups accentuate my natural shape. I barely felt the underwire even after wearing the bra for hours on end, and it never dug in or poked me. What experts say: This bra is ""fabricated with very cool-feeling mesh cups that gently shape breasts and conceal without adding bulk,"" says Teich. The brand claims ""semi-opaque nipple coverage,"" which we found to be true during testing. The lift is subtle but shapely. How it fits: ""It runs true to size, even in larger sizes, which can be rare,"" says Teich. When I tested a Cuup bra, I loved that it had thicker straps than average bras in my size and that the side and back panels are wider to create a smoothing effect. The scoop-neck cut was completely undetectable, even under my thinnest shirts. Keep in mind: While it fits well, ""the elastic on the band stretches out more quickly than most bras I've tried,"" says Teich, who even tried sizing down in a band to offset. Pros Widest size range available, from 30A-50H

Lightly lined mesh cups add shape, not bulk

Versatile scoop-neck cut Cons Band loosens over time $78 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $78 at Macy's

Amazon Best minimizer bra Vanity Fair Back Smoothing Minimizer Bra Fabric: 78% nylon, 22% spandex | Sizes: 36C-42H | Colors: 20 | Style: T-shirt | Coverage: Full plunge Why we love it: If you're looking to downplay your cup size, this full-coverage bra from Vanity Fair is our top pick for the best minimizer bra. Designed to reduce your bust by up to 1.5 inches, it features a built-in underwire and two non-padded cups that provide comfortable coverage and reliable support. What experts say: ""Depending on the bra style and if you need a larger cup size, you might look for side panels or a wide back band and straps. These details are more critical in bras for people with fuller busts — anything over a DD,"" Dale says. This option delivers, with extra side and back bands that are made from a four-way stretch material that smooths any bumps and bulges to create a sleek base. How it fits: ""I swear this might be the most comfortable underwire bra I've worn in a while, possibly ever,"" says Executive Editor Nicole Sforza. ""This bra is a minimizer and I really felt an immediate difference putting this bra on after having a non-minimizer on. I definitely feel like it's keeping the girls in place."" The fabric and fit ""feels very smooth and soft like buttah — even at the tightest level."" Keep in mind: Some shoppers say the underwire can get uncomfortable by the end of the day. It's also only available in limited sizing; there's no band size below 36, and only in cup sizes C-H Pros Immediate minimizing effect

Smoothing side and back panels

Budget-friendly Cons Underwire may be uncomfortable for some $27 at Amazon

Spanx Best no-bulge bra Spanx Bra-llelujah! Lightly Lined Full Coverage Bra Fabric: 72% nylon, 28% spandex | Sizes: 32A-40DDD | Colors: 5 | Style: T-shirt | Coverage: Full Why we love it: This smoothing, full-coverage bra from Spanx has been one of my personal go-tos for years — and for good reason. Designed with long-term comfort and support in mind, it features the brand's patented SmartStretch straps, which are engineered to stay in place and resist slipping throughout the day, which I can attest to. What experts say: ""What don't I love about this bra? The front clasp is so much easier than traditional back hooks, especially when you're dealing with any sort of shoulder issue,"" says Commerce Editor Saundra Latham, who added that the seamless construction creates an ultra-smooth foundation under clothing. Even Jennifer Garner is a fan. She once told the brand, ""You guys have no idea how many friends I've turned on to the Bra-llelujah!"" How it fits: I found that the underwire offers support without digging in, and the back panel — made from the same soft, stretchy hosiery material Spanx is known for — adds to the overall comfort. ""The straps stay put, and the stretchy material really helps smooth out any lumps and bumps. It's just as comfy as my non-underwire bras, but more supportive and great under T-shirts,"" Latham says. Keep in mind: There's limited sizing; for example, 32 bands cap out at a DD cup and 40 bands are only available in D and DD cups. Pros Comfortable, structured cups

Smoothes your sides and back

Convenient front closure

Nonslip straps Cons Comes in limited band sizes in certain colors $48 at Spanx Explore More Buying Options $68 at Nordstrom$68 at Amazon

Amazon Best loungewear bra True & Co Body Lift V Neck Bra Mink Materials: 77% nylon, 23% spandex | Size range: XS to 2XL | Colors: 6 options | Style: Lounge | Coverage: Full Why we love it: This buttery-soft wireless bra is made of a blend of elastane and nylon for both comfort and snap-back stretch designed to retain its shape even with daily wear. Its seamless knit band gently hugs my body, offering reliable lift and support — all without the need for an underwire. What experts say: The sleek V-shaped neckline extends from front to back for a clean, flattering silhouette. I loved that the wide, supportive straps stayed in place all day, and the fabric’s soft, smooth feel was an absolute standout. How it fits: I found this bra lives up to its promise — and I can personally attest that it holds up well over time. It includes removable pads for a little extra shaping; I tried it both ways and found it looked equally flattering with or without them. Keep in mind: This is a true full-coverage bra. If you have a smaller bust like I do, expect minimal cleavage — something to keep in mind if you're looking for a more revealing style. Pros Soft, seamless material

Barely there feel

Supportive underband Cons Full coverage means no cleavage for smaller busts $50 at Amazon

Amazon Best unlined bra PrimaDonna Madison Full Cup Bra Fabric: 75% polyamide, 7% polyester, 18% elastane | Sizes: 34B-44I | Colors: 14 | Style: T-shirt | Coverage: Full Why we love it: Anyone with a larger bust knows they typically have to choose between a bra that looks good and one that offers enough support. Luckily, this PrimaDonna bra for large breasts is pretty and sturdy. Our editors and bra expert Dale recommends it, saying the brand is ""pricey but worth every cent."" What experts say: ""This is my go-to bra for any situation,"" says Senior Home Editor Jessica Dodell-Feder. ""Even though it's lace, it works under nearly any kind of shirt and is the perfect balance of comfortable and supportive. I've been buying this bra (replacing it every five years or so, which is probably not often enough) since 2009!"" How it fits: During testing, Latham said, ""The sides did a great job of smoothing me out and eliminating any of that dreaded armpit fat."" As far as oomph, ""It offers a ton of lift — almost shelf-like,"" says Dodell-Feder, who loves that it helps separate and elongate her torso. Keep in mind: Dodell-Feder never experienced any digging or pinching, though she does note that ""because the cups are on the deeper/larger side, sometimes they gap a little if I've lost weight."" Latham added that while it's ""by no means uncomfortable, the checkered fabric and lace had a distinctive feel that makes this less of a lounge-around bra than a go-to-work or out-to-dinner bra."" Pros Side and back panels offer smoothing support

Designed for serious lift without bulk or padding

Perfect balance of comfort, style and support Cons Expensive $155 at Amazon

Harper Wilde Best bralette Harper Wilde Bliss Bralette Fabric: 79% nylon, 21% spandex | Sizes: XS-6XL | Colors: 15 | Style: Bralette | Coverage: Full Why we love it: Thousands of shoppers can't get over how comfortable and supportive this popular bra is. It's made with no foam, cups, wires or padding, making it so comfortable that many shoppers say they forget they're wearing it. What experts say: This bra is a top pick from Kimmay Caldwell, expert bra fitter and founder of undergarment education brand Hurray Kimmay. There is no underwire on the bralette, but it does have a thick underband that provides support and keeps it from riding up. How it fits: In my testing, I could barely feel it on. Its durable microfiber fabric gave me the lift and support I needed without sacrificing comfort, and it was honestly the softest material I've ever worn. Keep in mind: I found this bra to be true to size, though the brand recommends sizing up if you want less of a compressive fit — some reviewers say it runs small. Pros Very soft, comfortable microfiber

Wireless design is still supportive

Comes in a wide range of sizes Cons Runs slightly small $46 at Harper Wilde

Rebecca Carhart/Yahoo Best strapless bra Wacoal Red Carpet Convertible Strapless Bra Fabric: 91% nylon, 9% spandex | Sizes: 30B-44I | Colors: 3 | Style: Convertible | Coverage: Full Why we love it: I've had this bra for years and never had any issues with it staying up, even during long nights of dancing at weddings and other events. Teich agrees: ""The structured cups do a lot to keep this bra up and in place,"" she says. It even comes with removable straps, so you can add them when you need extra support or want to convert it to a halter or criss-cross style for racerbacks. ""While strapless bras can sometimes buckle at the base with repeated wear, this one has strong molded cups that give a nice rounded shape and has held up beautifully through five-plus years of wear,"" Teich says. What experts say: ""It's rare to find a strapless bra that doesn't flatten, dig in or slip down, but this one manages to do all three,"" Teich says. Its molded cups and light foam padding smooth you out and provide a comfortable, natural shape. ""The boning on the sides help to keep this bra in place. Silicone strips that run along the band also help."" How it fits: Some customers say the cup sizes run small, and in my testing, I found the same to be true (I'm typically an A cup, which the brand doesn't offer in this style, but surprisingly, the B cup fits me; definitely be sure to check the size chart before you buy.) It looks super smooth under all types of fabrics, though Teich notes that in order to achieve that smooth look, the bra comes up rather high, so it may peek out of some dress silhouettes. Keep in mind: After wearing it for hours, it can start to feel like it's digging in. (To be fair, I've noticed that with all strapless bras since they have to stay up on their own.) The trade-off is its durability, Teich says. Pros Durable and long-lasting

ThirdLove Best bra for asymmetrical breasts Third Love 24/7 Classic Uplift Plunge Bra Fabric: 76% nylon, 24% spandex | Sizes: 32AA-44H | Colors: 11 | Style: T-shirt | Coverage: Plunge Why we love it: This bra comes in half-cup sizes to help dial in a more precise fit. In addition to nonslip straps that stayed in place all day during testing, the bra includes removable inserts, which are especially helpful if your breasts are slightly different sizes. I appreciated the soft material and the delicate mesh overlay, which added a nice visual touch. What experts say: ""ThirdLove offers some of the most inclusive sizing options on the market, with half-sized cups and cup sizes extending up to DDDDD (H),"" Teich says. How it fits: Women with smaller cup sizes know how challenging it can be to find a bra with a snug-fitting band that doesn’t gape at the cups. I've always fallen between an A and B cup, so I was eager to try the A½ size, and it fit remarkably well. Keep in mind: The underwire offered solid support and remained comfortable for most of the day, though I did notice it slightly by evening, something Teich also experienced with ThirdLove bras. ""The band sits lower than my usual style, which means the underwire sits against my ribs a bit uncomfortably,"" she says. There's also limited sizing for band sizes 40-44. Pros Available in half-size cups

Removable inserts to acommodate asymmetrical breasts

Victoria's Secret Best push-up bra Victoria's Secret Bombshell Double Shine Strap Push-Up Bra Fabric: 65% polyamide, 35% spandex | Sizes: 30AA-38DDD (F) | Colors: 35 | Style: Push-up | Coverage: Demi Why we love it: Victoria's Secret bras have always been known to add a little extra va-va-voom to your bustline, and this popular push-up bra held true to the brand's reputation during testing. What experts say: The cups have padding in two places: the bottom and the side, which really boosts your bust. There are also a ton of styles to choose from, ranging from classic nudes for everyday wear to lacy designs for special occasions. How it fits: I've honestly never had more cleavage than when I wore this push-up bra. Not only did it make my breasts appear bigger, but I also loved how smoothing and supportive it was. The plunging neckline allowed me to wear a variety of different tops with it, and the straps and band were fully adjustable, which let me find a comfortable fit for my shape. Keep in mind: ""Victoria's Secret tends to have limited options for small band/large cup combos,"" says Teich, and that holds true for this style: Cup sizes DDD (F) are only available in band sizes 36 and 38; DD cups start at a 34 band size. Pros Doubly padded cups provide great lift

Adds the appearance of up to 2 cup sizes

30+ color and pattern options Cons Comes in limited band sizes $55 at Victoria's Secret

Amazon Best everyday bra Simone Perele Andora 3D Molded Bra Fabric: 79% polyester, 11% elastane, 10% polyamide | Sizes: 30B-40G | Colors: 8 | Style: T-shirt | Coverage: Demi Why we love it: A favorite of expert bra fitter Caldwell, this stunning bra holds up reliably enough for daily wear, while the delicate floral embroidery along the band and straps gives it a refined, elegant feel — one that leans more special-occasion than everyday basic. What experts say: ""Bras are a lot like jeans — everybody has a different favorite depending on what fits their body best and the style they’re going for,” Caldwell says. ""That said, there are a few great basic bras that fit well on a wide range of people."" This Simone Perele bra topped her list of crowd-pleasers, and after testing it, I can see why. How it fits: The lightly molded cups created a smooth, contoured silhouette without adding bulk, offering a natural shape that looked great under clothing. I found the bra exceptionally soft, supportive and comfortable. Keep in mind: The band runs large; reviewers and the brand recommend sizing down: ""For closer fit, order one band size down and one cup size up. (34C should order 32D)."" Pros Soft and comfortable

Molded cups give shape without bulky padding

Pretty lace details Cons Band runs large $110 at Amazon

Amazon Best sports bra Nike Swoosh Sports Bra Fabric: 88% recycled polyester, 12% spandex | Sizes: XXS-XXXL | Colors: 7 | Style: Sport | Coverage: Full Why we love it: This medium-support pull-on sports bra offers light compression while you move and sweat. Thousands of Amazon shoppers and our own editors, like Senior Deals Writer Britt Ross, are fans. What experts say: ""I hate wearing sports bras. Nikes are the only ones that don't feel like they're digging into my skin,"" Ross says. ""I appreciate that they come with different levels of support — high, medium and light."" It uses Nike's Dri-Fit fabric, designed to pull moisture away from the skin to help keep you dry. How it fits: ""I like light support, since I hate feeling too constricted, but even this one makes me feel like everything is held in place,"" Ross says, adding that she feels securely supported when she wears it for spin workouts. Keep in mind: The straps are not adjustable, and Teich warns that even the high-support style may not offer enough support for larger breasts or high-impact activities like running. Pros Affordable

Available in different support levels

Material is sweat-wicking Cons May not be supportive enough for high-impact workouts $38 at Amazon

How we chose the best bras

When it comes to finding the best bras, the most important thing is finding the ones that work for a range of cup sizes, breast shapes and goals and of course, comfort. I consulted professional bra fitters, intimates designers and lingerie experts to gather trusted guidance on what makes a truly great bra.

Using their insights, I spent more than 10 hours researching bra brands, styles, claims and specs, narrowing it down to 50 top-rated bras across a range of styles and price points. I considered availability and range of sizing, colors and customer feedback to find the ones worth testing.

Next, our team of experienced shopping editors and product reviewers tested over 30 standout styles to determine which ones truly deliver. We asked each for insight on the perfect bra, from fit to style, with testers ranging in cup sizes A-G and preferences from wireless barely-there bralettes to structured underwire bras that give lift and separation.

In our tests, we evaluated each bra based on comfort, support, style, quality and durability. Our testers weighed in on what makes each bra comfortable, whether it stood up to repeated wear and laundering and how it performed over time. After crunching all of the research, we found the bras worth a spot in your lingerie drawer.

Factors to consider when shopping for a bra

Size: An ill-fitting bra can lead to daily discomfort like chafing, shifting band, slipping straps, gaping cups and may contribute to neck, back or breast pain, especially for people with larger breasts. There are many online guides and videos that walk you through finding your bra size process, but if you're unsure, specialty lingerie stores often offer free professional fittings. Ultimately, trying on several styles and sizes is the best way to find what truly fits and feels right, since sizing can vary between brands and bra types.

Fit: A well-fitting bra can make a significant difference in comfort and support. Your bra should fit ""securely and comfortably around your rib cage without gapping or overflowing in the cups,"" says Dana Donofree, breast cancer survivor and founder/CEO of the bra brand AnaOno. ""Your chest should feel supported and at ease, so the bra shouldn't ride up in the front or back, and the straps should rest comfortably on your shoulders.""

The cups shouldn't bulge or gap. Bulging may indicate the cup is too small or the straps are too tight. ""The top of the cup should contain the breast without bulging or gaping,"" says Jessica Pfister, vice president of Dreamfit Intimates.

The ""underwire should follow the perimeter of the breast tissue and rest on the ribcage,"" says Pfister.

""The bra band should fit snugly around your body , anchoring both the cups and the underwire in place,"" says Pfister.

""The band of the bra should fit horizontally across the back. If it rides up in the center, this indicates that the weight of the breasts is pulling the back of the band up and the band is too large,"" Pfister warns. You may need to go down a band size.

The center of the bra, called the gore, should lie flat against the breastbone. And if your straps are adjusted properly, you should be able to fit two fingers comfortably underneath.

Fabric: ""A bra should be made from good-quality components,"" says Annette Smith, brand director for Montelle Intimates. ""Quality elastic, foam, mesh and fabric will ensure your bra lasts for many months still doing the job it was meant to do."" When it comes to soft, comfortable fabrics, Pfister says it's hard to beat certain tried-and-true materials. ""Personally, I think there is nothing better than a super-soft microfiber, modal or cotton spandex bra. They look smooth and feel incredibly comfortable.""

As for lace, Pfister says that ""fabric technology is so amazing now that you can have the most incredible lace bra that has a finish on it to make it feel just as soft and yummy against the skin.” Smith agrees, adding, ""lace bras are not itchy if they are good quality.""

Support: When it comes to breast support, ""think of it as building a bridge,"" Dale says. ""You don’t need much to cross a small creek on foot, but you want structural steel to carry the weight of a car. The same goes for bras.

""Many A through C cups can get by without much in the way of wires. Once you get beyond that point, the D through G cups, you'll want underwires, side panels, etc. When you go up to G cups, you'll want to buy bras from brands specializing in those bigger cup sizes.""

Adjustability: Choosing bras with adjustable bands and straps is key to achieving a personalized fit, says fit expert and educator Kimmay Caldwell, founder of HurrayKimmay.com. ""Often people mistake comfort with loose, carefree bras. But those tend to be loose, roam around and not fit well. So many of the clients I've fit said they want wire-free and stretchy, but once they're in the right size, they love the feel and look of a wired bra,"" she says.

Advertisement Advertisement

Style: Choosing the right silhouette ""all depends on your lifestyle and your aesthetic,"" Smith says. Think about the purpose of your bra: If you're shopping for a comfortable bra to wear every day, you may want to consider a T-shirt bra that offers more coverage and support, while if you're looking for a sexier option for special occasions, you may consider a pretty balconette option, a push-up style or a plunging bra.

Other bras we tested

Delimira Balconette Bra: Deals writer Carrie McCabe says this plus-size Delimira bra isn't bad overall, but noted that it had some sizing issues. ""Nice fabric and good smoothing; not too tight around the band and felt accurate to the 40 sizing. However, I wish they had DDD cup sizes, especially considering this is a plus-size specific bra,"" she says. Overall, she found it comfortable despite its underwire, though she did notice some gaps and spillage due to the cup-size issue.

Freya Idol Underwire Molded T-Shirt Bra: Dodell-Feder and Gifting Editor Amanda Garrity tested this Freya option and felt it slightly missed the mark. ""I'm a wireless bra wearer through and through,"" Garrity says. ""And when I want a little more shaping, I typically opt for lightly lined underwire styles that are still comfortable enough for all-day wear. That said, this bra doesn't exactly fit the bill. It's comfortable enough, but I wasn't a fan of the fabric or the fact that the band was too tight (despite knowing this is my right size)."" Doddell-Feder notes, ""I generally love Freya bras and have tried many styles over the years. This is not one of my favorites. I thought the shaped cups didn't wear well, and this isn't the most comfortable design. The gore (center part between the cups) comes up pretty high, which I think affected the fit.""

Harper Wilde T-Shirt Bra: I loved that the straps on this everyday T-shirt bra were adjustable from the front, and the clasp in the back to convert it into a racerback was a nice bonus. Unfortunately, I found that the cups cut into me weirdly. The bra looked good from the front, but the cups cut off on the sides at a weird spot, causing spillage. I didn't notice other reviewers having this issue, so I may have needed to go up a cup size.

Natori Bliss Perfection Soft Cup Bra: This wire-free option felt great, and I often forgot that I was wearing it. The only reason it didn't win out for best wire-free bra was the lace panel at the bottom. I liked that it gave the otherwise plain bra a sweet, feminine touch, but it sometimes rolled or folded up as I was wearing it.

Skims Unlined Balconette Bra: The fabric on this Skims bra was silky smooth, and I was really impressed by how soft it was. But I found the underwire to be a bit thicker and more uncomfortable than other options I tested. The bra fit great and looked really nice on though. And I really appreciated the size range and color options available.

Soma Embraceable Enchanting Lace Demi Bra: This demi-cup bra from Soma has a sweetheart neckline that reveals a hint of cleavage while still giving you the support you need. The memory-foam blend cups give a nice shape but aren't full coverage, so you can still let a bit of cleavage peek through a tank top with a plunging neckline. I really liked this bra and found it very comfortable, but just preferred others more.

Warner's No Side Effects T-Shirt Bra: Ross liked that this T-shirt bra by Warner's was ""supportive without being uncomfortable,"" but she didn't really notice much smoothing happening from the side bands, and she noticed some gaps on the sides. In general, she found it pretty comfortable, even though she rarely wears bras with underwire. ""Overall, it's a solid T-shirt bra, but beware of some gapping.""

Best bra FAQs

How many bras should I own?

Everyone will have a different answer for this question, depending on their lifestyle and preferences, but Teich recommends at least four, depending on occasion. Her recommendations:

Advertisement Advertisement

One to two everyday t-shirt bras for daily wear.

One to two sports bras for exercise.

One to two specialty bras , such as push-up bras, convertible bras, strapless bras or even maternity or nursing bras.

One to two comfort bras, like a bralette or wireless bra for lounging, sleep or comfortability.

How often should you wash bras?

For regular wear, a good rule of thumb is to wash your bra every two to three wears to prevent the buildup of sweat, body oils, bacteria and odor. Teich warns, though, ""that each time you wash your bra, you slightly degrade its integrity — the elastic, wire and hardware will wear down over time, so it's a balance of washing as much as necessary without overdoing it.""

One caveat, she says: how much you've perspired. ""During sweatier summer months when you're sweating more, you may want to wash your bras more often, maybe even after every wear,"" she says. ""And sports bras should be washed after every use, since they're highly saturated with sweat.""

How do I wash my bra?

If you are investing in a high-quality bra, you need to properly care for it to help it keep its shape and softness. ""Throwing them in the washer and using your typical clothing soap will ruin the elastic, shape and material, making it harsh and brittle and dented,"" Caldwell says.

If you need to wash them frequently but want to preserve their structure, Teich recommends hand-washing in cold water with a gentle detergent, and hang-drying. To keep your bras in the best condition:

Advertisement Advertisement

Always follow the care instructions on the label, which may recommend hand-washing or using a lingerie bag in the washing machine on a delicate cycle.

Avoid the dryer — air-drying is best to maintain fit and longevity.

""Air-dry by hanging the bra from its gore,"" says Teich. ""Never hang your bra by the straps or the band to prevent the fragile elastic from prematurely stretching out.""

Rotate between several bras to give each one time to rest and recover its shape.

Should you wear a bra to bed?

There is no scientific evidence suggesting that wearing a bra to bed negatively impacts breast health, according to National Center for Health Research. ""Similarly, there is no sufficient evidence that going braless will help reduce your risk of developing breast cancer,"" researchers say. Whether you wear one while you sleep is purely a matter of preference.

How can I find my bra cup and band size?

""First, you’ll need a tape measure marked in inches to take your rib and bust measurements,"" says Noemi Diaz-Justino, senior design director at lingerie brand True & Co. Here's how, according to Diaz-Justino:

Wrap the tape measure snugly (not tight) around your ribcage, directly under your bust, keeping it parallel to the floor. Round to the nearest whole number — this actual underbust measurement is your band size.

Next, measure loosely around the fullest part of your bust, making sure the tape measure is level.

To find your cup size, subtract your band measurement from your bust measurement . Each inch of difference typically corresponds to a cup size: 1 inch = A cup 2 inches = B cup 3 inches = C cup 4 inches = D cup 5 inches = DD 6 inches = DDD (or E, depending on the brand)



If you're between sizes, trying on multiple sizes and styles is still the most reliable way to find the right fit.

For those of us looking for a reason to ditch our gel manicures, now might be just time to switch to nontoxic nail polish for good. Concerns over the potential harms of gel formulas are nothing new, but earlier this year, the European Union officially banned the use of an ingredient that's found in — and essential to the efficacy of — many gel polishes, identifying the chemical trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide, or TPO, as a type of “reproductive toxicant."" In its announcement, the European Commission cited clinical studies that showed reduced fertility in animals ingesting high levels of TPO.



To be clear, this is not a complete ban on these polish systems. And, it's important to note that not all experts agree with the accuracy of these findings. However, nontoxic nail polishes might be a good idea anyway — they're not only an alternative to gels but also the conventional drugstore brands you picked up in your youth. While those classic nail lacquers remain widely used and FDA-approved, some still contain trace amounts of chemicals like toluene or formaldehyde-related compounds, which has raised questions about their potential impact on long-term health. Though more research is needed, these concerns have prompted a shift toward formulations labeled as ""3-free,"" ""7-free"" or even ""10-free"" — indicating they are made without certain controversial ingredients.

In researching this story over the past few months, I began to see nontoxic nail polishes as less crunchy-hippie-unnecessary and a lot more mainstream-appealing. Especially since these products have become just so good. In the past, non-toxic nail products were inferior in almost all ways to their conventional counterparts, swiping on streaky with bland color options and annoyingly short wear times. But innovations in nail care mean you can now find non-toxic polish alternatives in a range of coveted shades and — as with our top pick below from Dazzle Dry — with sturdy and long-lasting finishes too.

Over the past year, I've consulted with some true nail pros and tested more than a dozen nontoxic nail polishes. The following are my expert-approved picks for the best of the year.

The best nontoxic nail polish of 2025

Dazzle Dry Best nontoxic polish overall Dazzle Dry Mini Kit 4-Step System Shades: 150+ | Finish options: Cream, iridescent, iridescent, metallic, glitter, pearl, satin, clear | Cruelty-free: Yes My personal biggest issue with non-gel manicures is how quickly they chip (I am but a clumsy lady with bear paws, I need a long-wearing nail polish!), but Dazzle Dry's four-step system (prep, undercoat, polish, top coat) is the only nontoxic nail formula I've encountered that has the longevity of gels without the potential harm. ""Natural or 'clean' polishes tend to wear off faster than conventional formulas, but Dazzle Dry is an exception because it’s formulated for durability,"" explains Mazz Hanna, award-winning celebrity manicurist and CEO of the nail talent and training agency, Nailing Hollywood. ""When applied correctly, it can last anywhere from seven to 14 days without chipping, which is impressive for a non-gel, nontoxic polish."" Not only are Dazzle Dry polishes long-lasting but they're also conveniently fast-drying — mine were hard enough to type, drive and wash my hands within four minutes. ""Unlike traditional polishes, which rely on slow-drying solvents, Dazzle Dry uses a quick-drying formula that air cures in about five minutes without needing a UV or LED lamp,"" says Hanna. ""It’s truly an innovative formula that I recommend to everyone!"" Dazzle Dry products are 14-free, meaning they don't include 14 of the top, harshest chemicals found in conventional polishes, including the exclusion of nitrocellulose, which often leaves a yellow stain on your nails. Though the four-step process is a bit tedious, if you're an at-home polisher, the results were, from my experience, worth it. Best of all, when you're through with your color, you don't have to head to the salon to have Dazzle Dry soaked off like you do with a gel or dip system; the polish comes off easily with a standard remover. Last, while the initial ""system"" cost is a little pricey at $39, the polishes themselves are just $13 (I am extremely into ""Red Hot Chile"" for spring). Amazon reviewers are also besotted with Dazzle Dry — the line has racked up nearly 2,000 five-star reviews: ""I am 56 years old and painted my own nails my whole life,"" says one happy customer. ""Have tried every polish under the sun. No matter what I used, I would be lucky to get 24 hours before something would chip. So grateful for a product that stays much longer, dries super fast and comes off with regular remover. I love this product. Only wish there were more color options to choose from!"" Pros Longest-lasting nontoxic polish we tested

Quick drying

Hypoallergenic

14-free formula

150 shade range

Removes easily

Won't ""yellow"" nails Cons System as a whole is pricey

Some users complain of thick polish texture

Four-step system is time consuming $39 at Amazon

Other top nontoxic nail polishes we recommend for 2025

ZOYA Best nontoxic nail polish shade range Zoya Nail Polish Shades: 600+ | Finish options: Cream, matte, metallic, satin, pearl, glitter, iridescent, clear | Cruelty-free: Yes Zoya is a veteran player in the nontoxic polish game, having arrived on the scene all the way back in 1986. Since then, the company has developed a vast array of color options and polish finishes — truly, the most impressive of any brand I've seen — while remaining vegan and 10-free. It's also a favorite of most every nail technician I've interviewed and can be found in many spas and salons. The one major downside is the finishes don't last as long as gels, a complaint you can get around by choosing a glitter option (like this shimmery navy-blue ""Dream""), which tends to stay put longer — mine lasted almost two weeks. Pros Incredible shade range

Precise brush

10-free formula

Easy availability Cons Most finishes chip

Formula is thick $12 at Amazon

Habit Best budget nontoxic nail polish Habit Cosmetics Toxin-Free & Sustainably Packaged Nail Polish Shades: 60+ | Finish options: Clear, sheer, semi-sheer, opaque, glitter, metallic | Cruelty-free: Yes Habit makes my second favorite of all the nontoxic nail polishes I tried. Mainly because its shades are incredibly cool and modern (I would seriously use them all). Plus, the sustainably-made bottles could not possibly be cuter. These polishes are completely toxin-free, vegan and leaping-bunny certified and contain skin-fortifying ingredients like myrrh extract to help strengthen nails. The downside here is they are not long-lasting, but with this many good colors to choose from, you'll want to frequently mix things up. Pros Shades are cool and modern

Formula is chemical-free, vegan and cruelty-free

Packaging is sustainable

Formula is fortified with myrrh and hibiscus extract to strengthen nails Cons Not long wearing

Colors are slightly less vibrant in person $14 at Amazon

Nailtopia Best strengthening nontoxic nail polish Nailtopia Bio-Sourced Chip-Free Nail Lacquer Shades: 70 | Finish options: Metallic, cream | Cruelty-free: Yes The most ""natural"" of all our nontoxic nail lacquer picks, Nailtopia's version is made with food-grade ingredients such as raspberries and spinach, along with a plant-based protein specially formulated to strengthen nails. Given the fact that it's completely chemical-free and plant-based, the shade options are wildly impressive. It's the best option for kids and those with extremely sensitive skin, even if the color is not as saturated as you want in a polish and it takes a while to dry. Pros Eco-friendly ingredient sourcing

Good for sensitive skin

Completely toxin-free

Expansive shade range Cons Pigment requires several coats to look opaque

Slow-drying $11 at Amazon

How we tested nontoxic nail polishes

I consulted with nail technicians along with TikTok and Reddit threads and hundreds of Amazon reviews to identify the top dozen nontoxic nail polish brands. I tried them on my own nails and rated them on ease of use, dry time, pigment quality, value and how long each lasted without chipping.

Nontoxic nail polishes we tested that didn't make the cut

I tried Gucci's extremely fancy, $35 ""nontoxic"" polish and not only was it barely nontoxic (it just cracks 3-free) it was also streaky and hard to apply. Similarly, the pigments in Essie's nontoxic Love line were extremely weak.

Nontoxic nail polish FAQ

How do I know if a nail polish is nontoxic?

Nontoxic nail polishes are typically labeled by how many potentially harmful chemicals they don’t contain — a shorthand known as “X-free” formulas.

Advertisement Advertisement

For example, many conventional polishes today are at least 3-free, meaning they’re made without dibutyl phthalate (DBP), toluene and formaldehyde — three ingredients that have raised health and environmental concerns.

From there, the numbers climb: 5-free, 7-free, even 15-free polishes exclude additional ingredients like formaldehyde resin, camphor, ethyl tosylamide and parabens. While there’s no universal standard or regulatory definition for these labels — in fact, the term ""nontoxic"" itself isn't regulated and therefore does not have a standard definition — they can still offer a useful guideline for shoppers who want to minimize exposure to certain chemicals.

If you're aiming for the cleanest formulas possible, opt for polishes with higher “free” numbers or, in some cases, like two of our top picks, those that market themselves as completely free of synthetic chemicals. Just keep in mind that “nontoxic” doesn’t always mean 100% risk-free — but it does reflect a growing demand for safer, more transparent beauty products.

What should I look for in a nontoxic nail polish?

Most experts I spoke with suggest seeking out products that are 5-free or higher — my top pick from Dazzle Dry is 14-free and there are loads of options that are also plant-based and vegan, if that's important to you.

Will nontoxic nail polish expire faster than regular nail polish?

Though there's usually no set expiration date, due to a lack of chemical preservatives, nontoxic nail polishes will most likely expire at least slightly more rapidly than regular nail treatments. If you notice the product has separated, even after you shake it, it's probably time to give it a toss. Even if an expired nail polish is not harmful, it will be less effective and your color will appear uneven.

2025-06-16 22:32:55+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/,"5 best eye creams of 2025 for dark circles, wrinkles and more","I've never met a person who likes their dark circles. Even with the best concealers, they're a huge pain to hide, but when left bare, they can make you look more tired than you might feel. As a journalist, writing about the best eye creams always feels a bit tricky, especially when attempting to answer the question: do eye creams actually work? The truth is, there's no one product that will disappear your under-eye pigmentation and wrinkles for good, no matter if said eye cream is literally made of caviar (I've seen it!) and costs more than your monthly grocery bill.



However, while no serum or lotion (or witchy potion) will ever completely banish the shadows, lines and bags under your eyes, there are formulas — specifically those containing peptides, retinol, caffeine or vitamin C and, to a lesser extent, niacinamide, ceramides and vitamin E — that have been clinically proven to constrict blood vessels while brightening pigment, reducing eye puffiness and/or softening fine lines, all of which makes the area look more youthful and awake.



With that in mind, over the past year, I tested 12 of the most popular under-eye treatments for dark circles and more. While several of the top eye cream brands — like SkinCeuticals A.G.E Advanced Eye Cream and La Mer's Eye Concentrate — are so fancy and expensive they should come with a monocle, I found them to be only moderately more effective at addressing skin concerns than the best drugstore options. Some pricier picks include ingredients that sound impressive (looking at you, U beauty and your ""diamond dust""), but — truly — you don’t need them. When it comes to skin care, it's easy to equate luxury with quality, but more often than not, what you're paying for is hope. I won’t interfere in the relationship between you and your budget god, but for my money, these are the most effective eye creams out there.

Amazon Best under-eye cream overall RoC Retinol Correxion Under Eye Cream Size: 0.5 ounces | Scented: No | Hero ingredients: Retinol | Form: Cream | Skin Type: Any skin type If you're looking for a low-cost retinol treatment to help with dark pigmentation and wrinkles, this is for you. RoC is the premier name in over-the-counter retinol, and its eye cream is highly rated, with more than 40,000 five-star Amazon reviews. It's excellent for improving the appearance of both fine lines and dark circles, and it's dermatologist-recommended too. I only wish it contained antioxidants and more nourishing ingredients. But for the price, it can't be beat. Pros Targets dark circles along with crow’s-feet, fine lines and puffiness

Stimulates collagen production

Lightweight texture

Absorbs easily

It works to temporarily constrict the blood vessels in the hollow directly beneath your lash line, making the area look smoother and brighter. My only complaint is that the product is a bit thick and not particularly hydrating, which makes it difficult to layer under makeup. Pros Ultra affordable

Contains 5% caffeine for potent depuffing and pigment minimizing

Works quickly to improve the appearance of undereye bags

Tightens skin Cons Thick consistency means it doesn't absorb as well as you may like

Where this one wins points over our other affordable option on this list — The Ordinary's serum — is that it blends much more smoothly under concealers and foundations, making it a strong choice for day. Pros Affordable

Paraben-free, fragrance-free and cruelty-free

Concentrated ingredients specifically formulated to brighten under eye discoloration

Absorbs fast

Works well under makeup Cons Doesn't contain retinol

Paula's Choice Best vitamin C eye cream Paula's Choice C5 Super Boost Eye Cream Size: .5 ounces | Scented: Yes | Hero ingredients: Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, polypeptide | Form: Cream | Skin Type: Any skin type It's hard to find a better quality eye serum than this vitamin C version from Paula's Choice (it's clinically formulated to brighten undereye discoloration while smoothing and firming the delicate skin in this area). The texture is lightweight, supple and extra-emollient and, while it doesn't contain retinol, for the ideal mix of antioxidants and actives, this is a cream I'd use in tandem with RoC.

How we tested under-eye creams

I reached out to dermatologists, scrolled through dozens of Reddit threads and, after selecting a dozen contenders, tested them on my own 52-year-old under-eye circles for 14 days each. I tested for ingredient quality, absorbency, comfort and/or irritation, value, if I could apply the product under makeup and, perhaps most importantly, if the product brightened the area overall.

Other under-eye creams we tested that didn't make the cut

Dr. Loretta Tightening Eye Gel : I'd heard such good things about Dr. Loretta's eye gel, but when I tried it myself I found the formula to be unremarkable, with little effect on my skin.

Musely The Eye Serum : Similarly, while skin care subscription service/beauty cult Musely is beloved for using high-quality, medical-grade ingredients, I found its retinol eye cream was grainy and hard to spread.

Kiehl's Powerful Strength Dark Circle-Reducing Vitamin C Eye Serum: This vitamin C eye serum burned my skin a bit and wasn't as effective as a similar version from Paula's Choice.

FAQs

What causes dark circles under eyes?

The purple-blue-red bruised appearance of the undereye is a complex problem to solve, in part because its causes are far-ranging. Dark circles may be the result of allergies or genetics (thanks, Mom!), literal exhaustion, poor diet, hyperpigmentation and — often — simply the loss of collagen and skin thinning that happens to most of us as we age. ""We have to be mindful of the fact that after age 40, you're losing 1% of your collagen production per year,"" says Los Angeles facial plastic surgeon Dr. Kay Durairaj. ""And by menopause, women could be losing 25 percent of the collagen they make — the factory shuts down production by 25 percent!""

What should I look for in an eye cream?

For the eye area, Dr. Durairaj first and foremost recommends high-quality products containing retinol or Retin A: ""Eyes are unique in that the skin is so thin there so many people do not use retinol or Retin A products on their eyes and eyelids because they think their skin can't tolerate it. That's the number-one fallacy [in finding a quality eye cream].""

Most experts I spoke with agreed with Dr. Durairaj's assessment, though some did so with stipulations. ""Yes, you need retinol in an eye cream, but also enzymes, peptides and antioxidants,"" says Kimberly Austin, an esthetician at the popular 7QSpa.

How can I prevent wrinkles in my under eye area?

""The [under-eye] skin is so delicate,"" Dr. Durairaj says. To further protect under eye skin, she suggests avoiding the abrasive use of makeup or makeup removers. ""We really like scrubbing and tugging and stretching the skin to draw cat eyes and things like that. But when we do that kind of thing, it truly worsens the skin quality.""

How should I use an eye cream?

Use your ring finger to apply a pea-sized amount to the area, starting from the corner and gently patting along until you reach the far corner of the eye. Remember to go slow and be careful not to pull or drag the skin, while still moving the product around: ""You want to improve circulation and oxygenation in this area the best you can,"" explains cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Ava Shamban.

2025-01-02 21:21:12+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/,"The best skin-tightening creams of 2025 for aging skin, recommended by a board-certified dermatologist","Getting older means getting wiser. It also means that our skin might be getting a little crepey — and not in that cool, Halloween-costume-type way. Over the years, aging skin loses its laxity, causing not only wrinkles but sagging too. But, can using the best skin-tightening cream help address this totally normal yet kind of annoying issue? Well, yes and no. Truth is, you could swim in a giant vat containing all of the best anti-aging skin care products, but it’s not going to give you the same firming result as a facelift.



“It’s important to note that at-home tightening creams take time to work, and their effectiveness is minimal and not as prominent as in-office treatments,” explains Dr. Omer Ibrahim, MD, FAAD, a board-certified dermatologist at Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. “There are a slew of minimally invasive treatments that utilize radio frequency and ultrasound, micro-needling, and laser treatments that work to stimulate collagen production. The changes are more noticeable [with those], especially after two to three months.”



Still, he says, at-home skin-tightening creams aren’t total BS. “As the skin ages, the scaffolding in the skin’s extracellular matrix that keeps the skin taut — namely, collagen and elastin — degrades due to time and cumulative UV damage,” says Ibrahim. “The skin also produces less and less collagen and at a slower rate, leading to saggy skin.” For the skin to truly tighten, Ibrahim says it’s necessary to help the skin repair that scaffolding — that’s why most of the tightening creams he recommends contain collagen-boosting ingredients like retinol, bakuchiol and some peptides.



With those ingredients in mind, Ibrahim recommends the following as the best skin-tightening creams to help with crepiness and sagginess. Note: These still won’t deliver, or even promise, “instant tightening” as other products (like the viral Peter Thomas Roth Instant Firmx Eye) do. That’s because “instant” firming products don’t work the same way as, let’s say, a retinol cream. “[Instant tightening products] contain ingredients that form a film to pull the skin taut temporarily,” says Ibrahim. So while you may see a tiny immediate result, he admits, it will not last.

Update, August 18, 2025: We checked all product prices and availability. Our No. 1 pick for best skin-tightening cream remains unchanged.

Best skin-tightening cream of 2025

Skintensive Best overall skin-tightening cream Skintensive Bakuchiol & Retinol Cream Benefits: Anti-inflammatory, wrinkle-smoothing, collagen-boosting | Formulation: Cream | Key ingredients: Bakuchiol, retinol and sea buckthorn berry | Size: 1.6 oz. | Skin type: Mature, dry, sensitive, eczema-prone According to Ibrahim, retinol and bakuchiol are two key ingredients for any firming product, so it makes sense that he recommends this face cream. Both help increase collagen production, though bakuchiol is often touted as a natural alternative to retinol, as it has fewer side effects and tends to be less irritating. So why would you need both ingredients in this cream, you ask? Turns out that bakuchiol and retinol can work together — really well. In fact, research shows that bakuchiol can actually enhance the effectiveness of retinol while helping to stabilize it. Alongside that power duo, this cream also contains sea buckthorn berry, which reduces inflammation in the skin, is rich in antioxidants and hydrates the skin. Users describe having firmer-looking skin that’s also brighter and more moisturized and even-toned with fewer noticeable wrinkles. Pros Formulated by Harvard-trained dermatologists

Made entirely in the U.S. with straightforward ingredients

Designed for eczema-prone and sensitive skin types

Contains 3% bakuchiol and 0.25% retinol

Made with antioxidant and collagen-stimulating ingredients Cons Contains coconut oil, which is highly comedogenic

Some users complain of a chemical-like scent

Some say it feels greasy $25 at Amazon

Other dermatologist-recommended skin-tightening creams for 2025

RoC Best budget skin-tightening cream RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream Benefits: Wrinkle-smoothing, collagen-boosting | Formulation: Cream | Key ingredients: Retinol, mineral complex, squalane | Size: 1 oz. | Skin type: All Retinoids, or products that contain topical vitamin A, are something that Ibrahim says to look for in skin-tightening creams. Makes sense — retinoids are extremely popular among skin care fans and one of the most studied compounds due to their numerous benefits for the skin. They stimulate the production of collagen, thicken the outer layer of the skin and improve the appearance of wrinkles, allowing the skin to appear tightened. This RoC night cream uses a stabilized proprietary retinol combined with a mineral complex, moisture-boosting glycerin and squalane for firmer skin and less visible wrinkles. On Amazon, it has received almost 15,000 five-star reviews that praise the product for making skin “firm, smooth, soft and wrinkle-free.” One over-60 reviewer called the change in her skin “dramatic,” saying that other people “really notice the difference in the firming effect.” Pros Noncomedogenic

Dermatologist-tested

PETA-approved and cruelty-free

Noticeable improvement in 12 weeks Cons Some users complain about the fragrance

Retinol percentage unclear

May experience tingling or redness $18 at Amazon

Glytone Best splurge skin-tightening cream Glytone Peptide+ Overnight Restorative Cream Benefits: Firming, wrinkle-smoothing, skin-plumping | Formulation: Cream | Key ingredients: Tetrapeptide complex, albizia extract, hyaluronic acid, glycolic acid | Size: 1.7 oz. | Skin type: All Peptides are another crucial skin-tightening ingredient, says Ibrahim, as they help build collagen, which in turn gives the skin a firmer appearance and reduces the look of fine lines and wrinkles. This night cream, which he recommends, contains an anti-aging tetrapeptide complex, which naturally activates the synthesis of collagen in the skin and stimulates the proliferation of keratinocytes (which improves the skin’s elasticity). It also features hyaluronic acid to keep things plump and hydrated, and glycolic acid, which is great for sloughing away dead skin cells to make the complexion bright and glowy. Another interesting ingredient in the cream is albizia extract, which is high in antioxidants and meant to combat fatigued skin. While this cream is suitable for most skin types, it is aimed at postmenopausal skin. If sagging or loose skin is a big issue, give this one a go. Multiple reviewers love how it “firms and tightens” the skin on their face and neck while also keeping it looking plump and moisturized. Pros Suited for mature skin

Works to even skin tone and texture

Reduces the appearance of wrinkles

Paraben-free Cons No added fragrance, but some users complain about the smell

Skin-tightening cream FAQs

When should I start using a tightening cream?

Skin-tightening creams make sense for those of us who are over 40 and want to treat sagginess in the face or neck. However, there’s no hard-and-fast rule for the best age to start using them, according to Ibrahim. “Start tightening products around the time you feel like you are ready for Botox,” he states. “For some people, it can be as early as the mid-20s; for others, it may be the late 30s.” (Personally, I didn’t use them until my 40s.)

How often should I use a skin-tightening cream?

When it comes to frequency, there’s no real rule either. This depends on the formulation and each individual’s skin, says Ibrahim. “If it doesn’t irritate the skin, the product can be used daily,” he says. “For those with sensitive skin, use it two to three times a week.” If you’re using a new retinol-based firming product, like RoC Retinol Correxion, you’ll probably want to start off slow, even if you’re an experienced retinoid user. However, something like Glytone Peptide+ Overnight Restorative Cream might be OK to use daily unless you’re sensitive to glycolic acid.

How do you apply a skin-tightening cream?

Ibrahim says that people often neglect the neck, décolletage and hands when it comes to their skin care products. Don’t be one of them! “Make sure to extend your application below your jawline, all the way down to just above your rib cage. Use the same products on your hands,” he says. Another thing to keep in mind is the importance of sunscreen. “The best way to mitigate skin laxity is through prevention,” says Ibrahim. “Always wear SPF and apply liberally.”

2025-06-26 17:53:10+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/,"The best single-serve coffee makers of 2025, tested and reviewed","The best single-serve coffee makers of 2025 come from brands like Nespresso and Keurig — and they brew it all! (Jessica Dodell-Feder/Yahoo)

Sometimes you need your morning buzz without having to do anything other than push a button. That's the beauty of the best single-serve coffee makers — you simply drop in a pod and fresh coffee is yours in just a couple of minutes. No wonder 42% of Americans own a single-cup brewer, according to the National Coffee Association.



Having worked as an editor at lifestyle and food magazines for 20 years, I've seen many single-use appliances that promise to make life easier, when all they do is clutter your counter. Although pod machines like Nespressos and Keurigs don't always produce the kind of brew you'd get from the best espresso machines, a great French press or a solid pour-over coffee system, they make a decent cup of joe — and they make it fast. Over the past year, I've tested more than a dozen of the best single-cup brewers, looking for ease of use, eco-friendliness and more. I brewed cup after cup of hot coffee (and espresso and iced coffee when the machines offered those functions). Yes, I was jittery for days ... and yes, it was worth it.

Best single-serve coffee makers for 2025

Jessica Dodell-Feder/Yahoo Best single-serve coffee maker overall Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Machine Water tank capacity: 40 oz. | Size: 8.7"" W x 12.7"" D x 12.8"" H | Cup sizes: Single and double espresso; 5 and 8 oz. coffee | Color options: Gray, red, black and matte black How it works: The VertuoPlus makes the coffee-brewing experience as easy as possible. You push just one button to operate it, and there's a mechanism that automatically tosses your used pod into a receptacle inside the machine. But how do I choose what kind of brew I want? you might be wondering, considering that there's no way to program the machine. Nespresso VertuoLine coffee machines use pods printed with a bar code that indicates the type of drink it makes. There are espresso pods for shots of espresso, coffee pods for an 8-ounce mug of joe and so on. Pop in the pod you want, and the machine automatically adjusts to brew your desired drink. Note that all Nespresso drinks are brewed with a layer of crema on top — I found it added to each cup's richness, but if that's not for you, you may prefer a machine that uses K-Cups. Why we love it: Nespresso pods produce tasty, high-quality cups of drip coffee and espresso in mere minutes. I adore the sleek look of the VertuoPlus (this model is made by De'Longhi; Breville also makes one with similar specs) and how compact it is for such a powerful machine. The 40-ounce water tank is movable — you can swing it to either side of the machine or keep it tucked behind it. I liked this flexibility, but I also found that it made the reservoir less secure. More than once I accidentally toppled it, getting water all over my counter. The VertuoPlus requires minimal upkeep: Just empty the used-pod receptacle, which holds about 10 pods, and descale (aka deep clean) every three months or 300 pods. Keep in mind that Nespresso Vertuo pods (of which there are many delicious variations!) cost more than $1 per each, so while using one is cheaper than buying a latte every day, this machine is an investment. Minor criticisms: One of my issues with single-serve machines is the amount of waste they produce, much more than a drip coffee maker that uses grounds. Many companies have tried to combat this with a reusable single-serve filter that you fill with grounds, but Nespresso only offers single-use aluminum pods. Not ideal — but at least the company offers a recycling program. You can drop off used pods at 250-plus locations or order free recycling bags with prepaid UPS labels. If you live in NYC or Jersey City, N.J., you can toss used pods in your curbside blue recycling bins. One final note: I found the paper instruction manual that came with most of the Nespresso machines I tested to be confusing. If you need guidance, I recommend checking Nespresso's website, which has how-to videos and manuals that are often different from what's in the box and more user-friendly. The brand's customer service is top-notch. Pros One-button operation

Brews premium coffee

Virtually maintenance-free

Movable water tank Cons Water tank didn't clip on securely

No reusable single-serve filter available

Jessica Dodell-Feder/Yahoo Best single-serve coffee maker for lattes Keurig K-Café Barista Bar Water tank capacity: 42 oz. | Size: 5.1"" W x 12.6"" H x 12.8"" D | Cup sizes: 2, 8, 10 and 12 oz. | Color option: Black How it works: The K-Café Barista Bar is a reliable Keurig machine that comes with a bonus for anyone who likes lattes, cappuccinos and other espresso-style drinks: a standalone milk frother. You press a button for cold or hot froth, then let it do its thing. As for the actual coffee maker, it's straightforward, with just five buttons for selecting the size and type of drink you want, including an option for brewing over ice. Cleanup is minimal — the machine has very few parts, so while they are hand-wash-only, it's a simple job. Why we love it: I'm not gonna lie, I had a grand time playing around with this machine. Keurig has long been the go-to for single-serve coffee makers because of their simplicity and affordability. The K-Café Barista Bar is a slim model that produces a steaming cup of joe (172 degrees, which is the hottest of almost all the models we tested). At 7.7 pounds, it's was also lighter than most, handy if you're need to move the machine around your kitchen. And it excels at making milky drinks. The frother can whip up both hot and cold froth that somehow manages to be both dense and fluffy. I liked it so much, I continued using the gadget well beyond my testing. And when I accidentally put it in the dishwasher (it's hand-wash-only), I found Keurig customer service helpful in getting me a replacement. This machine is the most affordable of our top picks, and Keurig frequently runs sales, not just on its coffee makers but also on Keurig K-Cups. Minor criticisms: K-Cups are plastic and recycling them can be difficult in some areas and messy (you have to pull the paper filter with grounds from its plastic casing). That said, Keurig has made some strides toward a more sustainable machine, and I appreciated that I could swap out one-time-use-only plastic K-Cups with the brand's dishwasher-safe reusable filter, which you fill with grounds. It's sold separately, but I paid only $8 for mine, a worthy investment. Pros Small footprint

Comes with standalone milk frother that makes both hot and cold froth

Can accommodate a reusable filter Cons Parts are hand-wash-only

Coffee had some sediment at bottom of cup when using the reusable filter and grounds $90 at Amazon

Jessica Dodell-Feder/Yahoo Best drip single-serve coffee maker Ninja DualBrew Pro 12-Cup Coffee Maker Water tank capacity: 60 oz. | Size: 11.4"" W x 9.1"" D x 15.5"" H | Cup sizes: (Pods) 6, 8, 10 and 12 oz.; (grounds) small, XL cup, travel mug and XL travel mug; (12-cup carafe) ¼, ½, ¾ and full | Color option: Black How it works: This machine is easy to operate right out of the box, thanks to stickers that tell you how to use each component. All of the DualBrew Pro's different parts (the milk frother, plus a 12-cup carafe and a ground coffee scoop) fit neatly onto the machine. Similar to the Nespresso VertuoPlus, the removable water reservoir can be adjusted — in this case, it swings from the side to the back of the machine and is secured with a latch. When I plugged in the DualBrew, I was even more impressed by the digital display, which is colorful and high-tech and makes choosing your desired brew easy. Why we love it: Ninja's DualBrew Pro is our pick for the best coffee maker that's also a total multitasker. It can accommodate single-serve K-Cups, but it also produces hot water and makes regular drip coffee, iced coffee and even lattes (it comes with an attached milk frother). Other perks include a mug stand that flips up to accommodate an extra-large travel mug, an automatic warming plate for the drip coffee carafe and the ability to produce both boiling and hot water. Don't worry about it tasting coffee-esque: The water dispenses from a separate outlet. I admit it did take me a bit of tinkering to understand how to use the adapter that lets you brew K-Cups. But once I figured it out, it was quick going, and I was able to make cup after cup, even when I was half-awake. You can also brew a single serving of coffee using grounds, but you follow the same steps you would to make a carafe of drip coffee, which means you need a paper or reusable filter. Ninja sends five paper filters to get you started; a permanent filter is sold separately. Taste is subjective, so I won't spend much space letting you know this machine did not produce my favorite coffee as far as flavor goes. But the lattes and other espresso-style drinks were tasty — and fun to make. Minor criticisms: I only had a couple of gripes with this machine. First off, it beeps loudly when it's done brewing, which seemed unnecessary, especially early in the morning! The other is that this machine has numerous components, so it can be a pain to take apart and clean. But most of the pieces are dishwasher-safe (unlike with other machines), so it's hardly a dealbreaker. Pros Makes a huge variety of drinks

User-friendly digital display

Movable water tank

Most parts are dishwasher-safe Cons Beeps loudly when done brewing

Requires paper or a reusable filter if brewing from grounds

Built-in milk frother gets a bit messy $150 at Amazon

Jessica Dodell-Feder/Yahoo Best single-serve coffee maker for iced coffee Keurig K-Brew+Chill Coffee Maker Water tank capacity: 70 oz. | Size: 9.8"" W x 15.35"" D x 12.16"" H | Cup sizes: 6, 8, 10 and 12 oz. | Color option: Black How it works: This machine brews both hot and cold coffee using K-Cup pods. According to Keurig, when you choose the ""cold"" option, the machine first brews hot, then that liquid travels through aluminum coils to a water-based thermoelectric chamber that flash chills it before dispensing it to the cup. It sounds complicated, but actually making a coffee with this machine is simple — you just press a button for hot or cold, select your desired amount (6, 8, 10 or 12 oz.) and hit the big ""K"" button. If you choose ""cold,"" an automatic rinse cycle will start as soon as the machine's done brewing. Why we love it: Generally, if you want iced coffee from a single-serve coffee maker, the best you're going to get is a ""brew over ice"" option — basically, hot coffee that's slightly more concentrated to make up for the fact that it becomes diluted as it melts the ice in your cup. Not the case with this hybrid home brewer, which came out in August 2024: In addition to brewing regular hot coffee from K-Cups, it produces legitimately cold coffee. I clocked it at 66.7 degrees, 100 degrees cooler than the hot version, with little to no ice melt. It's pretty amazing! In both cases, the coffee was smooth and flavorful, on par with you'd expect from the best iced coffee makers. There's also a ""strong"" button if you like your java on the more potent side. Minor criticisms: The only thing that's a tad annoying is the setup for this machine, as you have to first fill the cooler chamber with nearly 12 cups of water, and the opening is small. You'll definitely need a pitcher or measuring cup with a spout. But the brand says you'll only need to do this once a year or so to account for some evaporation. The cooling process also makes this machine noisier than most. Expect a constant hum, though you can dampen it by hitting the ""quiet"" button. Pros Brews both hot and legitimately cold coffee

Minimal maintenance

Works quickly

Water reservoir is large (70 oz.) and easy to fill

Control panel is intuitive Cons Takes up a ton of counterspace

What to look for when choosing a single-serve coffee maker

Of course you want your machine to brew good coffee, fast. But you should also consider these factors:

Ease of use: Even if you're not someone who makes coffee the second you wake up, you probably don't want to have to mess with a lot of settings every time a caffeine craving hits. The best machines offer you options to customize without a lot of fuss. Are you looking for a programmable single-serve coffee maker? Most Keurig and Nespresso machines don't have that function, but other models we tested, including the Ninja DualBrew Pro, do and can be quickly programmed with a few buttons.

Advertisement Advertisement

Size and weight: The top machines on our list don't have huge footprints — and they can tuck away under upper cabinets when not in use. You should also look at a machine's weight before buying if there's a chance you'll have to drag it to a different spot in the kitchen on a regular basis. Many of the machines are a pain to move around, so look for something on the lighter side, like the Keurig K-Café Barista Bar, which clocks in at about 7.7 pounds.

Color and design: Single-serve coffee makers typically look sleek and compact — no bulky coffee pots or built-in grinders. Most come in basic black or stainless steel, but if you're interested in making a design statement, consider the Nespresso Vertuo Plus, which is also sold in red or gray. Nespresso's Vertuo Pop+ (which we'll test soon) also comes in fun colors, as do several of Keurig's more compact models, including anything from the K-Mini line.

Eco-friendliness: Unlike with a regular drip coffee maker, you don't need a grinder or coffee beans to make coffee in single-serve machines because they use disposable pods (also called capsules or K-Cups). This creates a lot of trash, and so many companies try to counteract the idea that single-use machines are wasteful by touting how sustainable their brands are. Nespresso's Vertuo Next (read more about it below) is made from 40% recycled plastic, and both Nespresso and Keurig use recycled material in their boxes and packaging. K-Cups and Nespresso pods are also recyclable — though it does require some effort. If you are concerned about excess waste, your best bet is to find a machine that fits a reusable filter and use that with your favorite grounds.

Welcome to pod mountain — just some of the pods and K-Cups I ran through in testing. Did I mention I was jittery for days? (Jessica Dodell-Feder/Yahoo)

Variety of cup sizes: Do you want to brew just a shot of espresso and call it a day? Or are you looking for a machine that can make a wide range of drinks, from shots to 8-ounce coffee mugs to 12-cup carafes? Despite their name, many single-serve coffee makers can brew multiple sizes. They usually range from a 2- or 4-ounce shot to 12 ounces (for a travel mug's worth of coffee). But others can brew larger cup sizes and even carafes, handy if you're serving multiple family members.

Variety of drink types: All the machines we tested make espresso-style shots and most make 8-ounce mugs of coffee. But the options abound in some of the best coffee makers. If you're craving a powerful jolt, look for a button that lets you control brew strength — some Keurig machines, for example, feature a ""strong"" button for a more concentrated drink. Others include a button for making iced coffee or settings for making lattes or cappuccinos.

Water tank capacity: If you hate the idea of having to refill your machine's water tank every time you want another cup, then look for a reservoir that can hold at least 40 ounces. Don't leave water in the tank for extended periods of time; all the machines were very specific in their instruction to use fresh water for the best taste! Keurig machines even come with an optional water filter.

How we tested single-serve coffee makers

I made so much coffee it seemed like I should open a café out of my home. In all seriousness, I evaluated every machine from the moment I opened the box to its final brew. I used each machine at least five times, with an 8-ounce cup of coffee as my control, and kept in mind the following:

Advertisement Advertisement

Ease of use: Did setup take forever? Was the control panel intuitive? I wanted to make sure each machine was foolproof, even if you're operating on a couple of hours of sleep.

Speed: I timed each machine to see how quick it was. All the machines took less than two minutes to brew an 8-ounce cup, and most took less than 90 seconds.

Coffee quality: Though taste is subjective, I did note the coffee's flavor and smoothness, and whether there was any grit at the bottom of the cup. I also used a food thermometer to test the temperature of each freshly brewed cup.

Bonus features: Once I knew how the machines compared making regular joe, I tested any other brews they could make, including espresso, lattes and larger servings using grounds. If they came with an attachment (like a milk frother), I used that multiple times as well.

Keurig face-off! We tried these machines with standard K-Cups and with Keurig's reusable filter (the gray rounded-looking plug shown inside the machine). (Jessica Dodell-Feder/Yahoo)

I also had less technical considerations. I hunted for sleek design, pieces that fit together well and high-end finishes. After all, most of us keep our coffee machine on the counter in broad daylight — I wanted to make sure our top picks looked as good as they functioned.

Because taste is so subjective, I kept my notes on flavor to a minimum and instead focused on how hot the coffee was, its mouthfeel (did it seem watery?) and whether there was any grittiness or sediment left in the bottom of the mug.

Other single-serve coffee makers we tested

Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Trio 2-Way: This was one of the best programmable single-serve coffee makers I tried, with a clear-cut digital display and a solid range of cup sizes, from 6 ounces to 14. I also liked that it was quiet (no loud whirring or humming) and comes with its own reusable filter basket for ground coffee that tucks inside the cup rest when not in use. It would have made it to the top of this list if not for a few reasons: At about 12 inches wide and 12 inches deep, this machine takes up a ton of space (it has a carafe for drip coffee that sits next to the single-serve brewer); I also found sediment at the bottom of every cup I brewed. And it gets K-Cups searing-hot, so you have to wait quite a while before you can remove them.

Nespresso Essenza Mini: There's a reason this single-serve coffee machine resides in hotel rooms all over the world — it measures just 3 inches wide and 8 inches tall and makes decent single and double shots of espresso. I found it a bit loud and drippy, but if you're looking for something failproof and you love espresso, this itty-bitty brewer will do the trick.

Advertisement Advertisement

Nespresso Vertuo Next: If Nespresso never made the VertuoPlus, this machine would jump to the top of my list. Though it's narrower than the VertuoPlus, it makes five cup sizes to the VertuoPlus's four and offers Wi-Fi connectivity to an app so you can personalize your experience and keep track of your pod stash. Alas, this machine is noisier than the other models I tried, and you have to physically lock the machine after inserting a pod (it's not automatic like with the VertuoPlus). It takes some muscle, and I could see it becoming difficult for someone who doesn't have a ton of hand strength.

Nespresso Vertuo Lattissima: I love a good latte and so I loved this machine, which operates — and looks — almost exactly like the Vertuo Next but with one major upgrade: a built-in milk frother that lets you make a latte or cappuccino with the push of a single button. I've been using it for close to a year and it's reliably great. My one complaint is that it retails for around $350, almost twice the price of the Vertuo Next (unless you buy the Next with a standalone frother).

Keurig K-Elite: This machine made some of the strongest coffee of any Keurig machine I tried. Unfortunately it also looked pretty clunky, like something you'd see in a '90s office kitchen. I also found the buttons on this one confusing because they're just icons and don't indicate what size drink you're making. That said, it does offer lots of drink sizes and styles, and it gets raves on Amazon, with more than 55,000 five-star reviews.

Keurig K-Mini Go: At less than 5 inches wide, this pipsqueak is ideal for tight spaces, plus it comes in colors other than black, like navy, lavender and charcoal (as a design lover, I really appreciated this!). I liked its straightforward design and how easy it was to clean the few parts that needed it. It lacks the bells and whistles of other models, but at $100 (before sales kick in), it does enough, with three cup sizes and a ""strong"" option for a more concentrated brew.

Keurig K-Mini Mate: Want something even tinier? At less than 4 inches wide and 2.1 pounds, this is Keurig's smallest brewer ever. You fill up the tank with the exact amount of water you need for your cup (anywhere from 6 to 12 ounces), then press a single button. The result is a strong cup of coffee, but that's it — don't expect any bells or whistles. It doesn't get more basic than this machine, and for that reason I'd consider it best for a dorm room or Airbnb.

Keurig K-Supreme: A 66-ounce water reservoir means you can quickly make cup after cup with this model, which looks similar to the Keurig K-Mini Go. It's just as easy to use but slightly larger and features a movable water tank that can go from the back to the side of the machine. In theory it's a nifty feature; in reality it only caused me problems. I ran into the same issues I did with my beloved Nespresso VertuoPlus — the tank did not clip firmly onto the machine and so it proved very easy to knock over, leading to major spillage.

Cuisinart Single-Serve Coffee Maker SS-10: There is a lot to like about this programmable single-serve coffee maker — plus Cuisinart makes one of our top drip coffee makers. It has an LCD screen that leaves little room for confusion (I laughed when I saw it said ""not ready"" while I was filling the water tank), a handle by the brewing head that makes it easy to open and close, a reusable, dishwasher-safe filter and a water tank that holds a whopping 72 ounces. My only gripe was with its chunky size and design, which could use an update.

Single-serve coffee maker FAQs

What does 'single-serve' mean in a coffee maker?

A single-serve coffee maker brews enough coffee in one go for just a single cup. But the size of cup varies — most machines can make everything from 4 ounces of coffee to 12 ounces, so you're covered whether you want something akin to a shot of espresso or want to fill a large travel mug. To make matters more complicated, some machines do more than single servings and can also brew full carafes of drip coffee.

How do you clean a single-serve coffee maker?

It depends on the machine, but generally you should rinse the water tank regularly and hand-wash any removable components (some machines, like the Ninja DualBrew Pro, Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Trio 2-Way, Nespresso Vertuo Lattissima and Cuisinart Single-Serve Coffee Maker SS-10, have dishwasher-safe parts). As with any coffee maker, you'll also need to descale (a.k.a. deep-clean) your machine — check the manual for how often this should happen. For more details, check out our full-on tutorial guided by experts on how to clean your coffee maker.

Do single-cup coffee makers make good coffee?

You won't get the kind of brew you'd expect from an espresso machine, but you can come close with a Nespresso. For something closer to what you'd get from a drip coffee maker, a Keurig or other machine that uses K-Cups is the way to go. Both Nespresso pods and K-Cups come in a ton of varieties, with coffee sources from all over the world. They have limited-edition flavors, pods specifically meant for iced coffee and even celeb-crafted bean blends.

If you opt for a reusable filter with grounds, you have even more options because you can choose any bagged coffee you like.

Can coffee pods be recycled?

In general, yes. Nespresso offers free recycling bags for sending back its aluminum pods, and in some areas, you can drop them directly into recycling bins. Plastic Keurig K-Cups can be recycled in many areas, but double-check your local guidelines. To do so, you have to pull the paper filter and grounds from the plastic cup.

Is Keurig or Nespresso better?

It's all a matter of personal taste. Both companies make a huge range of machines with various levels of bells and whistles. Generally, Keurig machines are more affordable (they start at $90 in comparison to Nespresso's $130 entry point), whereas Nespresso machines are known for their quality of coffee.

Amazon Sealegend 2-Piece Dryer Vent Cleaner Kit $9 $12 Save $3 We all love that fresh-from-the-dryer feeling when we put on our clean clothes. But if your clothes have been coming out damp and soggy rather than soft and snuggly, you may need a vent cleaner. This dryer-declogging kit comes with a hose, an adapter and a guide wire. The guide wire functions kind of like a scrub brush to scrape, scoop out and loosen all sorts of dust bunnies you didn't know were hiding in the darkest depths of your dryer vent. The hose, however, is where the real magic happens. It's extra narrow, bendy and a full 32 inches long, so you can really get deep inside your lint trap to suck out all the nasties. The adapter easily attaches to most upright and stick vacuums (it needs a nozzle to attach to, so it won't work with robot vacuums), so it's versatile, depending on your vacuum of choice. At just $9 right now, this useful twosome is within 50¢ of its lowest price ever. $9 at Amazon

They're waterproof, have heavy-duty handles and easily fold down when not in use. Plus, they come with little tag pockets so you can jot down what's being stored in each. They don't go on sale for less than this very often, and they're within $2 of their all-time low. $20 at Amazon

Amazon Active Garbage Disposal Cleaner Deodorizer Tablets $20 | Lowest price ever These tablets make easy work of plowing through tough build-up and grime in your garbage disposal, a spot that's likely to get extra ""fragrant"" thanks to leftover Thanksgiving scraps.

Amazon Energizer Alkaline Power AAA Batteries, 32 Count $15 $24 Save $9 The only thing worse than running out of batteries?

Right now, these are only a few quarters above their all-time-low price for the year, so stash a few packs away — they're designed to last up to 10 years in storage. $15 at Amazon

Amazon Owala FreeSip Stainless Steel Water Bottle $28 $33 Save $5 Our Deputy Editor Izabella Zaydenberg is a huge fan of her FreeSip: ""I've remained faithful to my Owala FreeSip for the last few months, and I really can't see myself going back to any of the other bottles I've tried. It's stood up to a reasonable amount of wear and tear, but it still looks brand new. Most importantly, I find myself reaching for my water bottle over bad-for-me drinks more often. And hey, anything that can make water a little less boring is a win in my book."" $28 at Walmart

2025-11-26 18:37:02+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/,"Black Friday 2025 deals on gadgets and tech from Amazon, Apple, Bose and more are now discounted to some of the lowest prices of the year","What are you thankful for this Thanksgiving? Obviously, friends, family and health. But there are some other holiday fringe benefits, too. For some, it's all about the food. For others, it means watching a parade. For many of us, that NFL football triple header is a big attraction. And whether you're a bargain hunter or you're just starting your Christmas shopping a bit early, there are those Black Friday deals. Spoiler alert: The best deals are already up and running, and we've pulled together the best tech and gadget options right here.

Before the real chaos begins, a quick primer: Black Friday deals come in layers. Some are genuinely excellent price drops (like the $69 AirPods 4), some are recycled discounts dressed up for the holiday, and some aren't deals at all. This year, though, the standouts are obvious — AirPods 4 with ANC for $100, AirPods Pro 3 for $220 (lowest price ever), the latest iPad for $274, a Quinlianf 5-outlet charger for just $9 to power it all and even a rare Disney+ sale (the Mouse almost never discounts anything). Even AirTags are within a dollar of their best-ever price.

Trending Black Friday tech deals

AirPods 4 ($69, was $129): Lowest price ever

PS5 Slim ($399, was $500): Lowest price of 2025

Amazon Qinliaf 5-Outlet Extender $9 $13 Save $4 with Prime Considering installing a USB-outlet? Consider this surge-protecting outlet instead. You get five outlets plus four more USB charging ports (three USB type A and one USB-C).

PlayStation PlayStation 5 Digital Edition (slim) $399 $500 Save $101 | Lowest price this year When you couldn't care less about owning a physical library of games, the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition is here for you. The Digital Edition always retails for less than the disc version, but right now it's even more appealing, after a 20% Black Friday price drop. It's the best price this year by 9%, and this edition still has the same 825GB SSD, with blitz-worthy download speeds, haptic immersion and marvelous audio. Instead of buying discs, a connection to the PlayStation store enables you to buy offline and download directly onto your machine. The downside is that you won't have access to used games and some third-party game sales, but you'll save money up front, especially right now. If you plan to shop for games through PlayStation's store, this is a good pick. (And if you do want to add a disc drive later, you can buy a snap-on accessory.)

Amazon RedTiger 4K Dash Cam $100 $150 Save $50 Imagine this: You're stopped at a red light when the car in front of you starts to back up. Before you have time to think, let alone react, bam! They hit your car, but claim you rear-ended them. Unfortunately, these kinds of insurance scams are all too common, and unless you have a dashcam that shows what actually happened, you might be shelling out a lot of dough to make this problem go away. Fortunately, high-quality cams don't have to cost an arm and a leg. This one is 33% off for Black Friday and is also an Amazon No. 1 bestseller. $100 at Amazon

Walmart M1 MacBook Air, 13.3-Inch $549 $649 Save $100 If you have the money to go with the 13-inch Air above — it's only $200 more and comes with the latest chip and twice the RAM — that's what I would recommend. But if your goal is to find the cheapest factory-new MacBook you can buy, this is it. Yes, the M1 chip is a couple of generations old — Apple's latest Air laptops run on the M4 (and the M5 has already been announced) — but compared to the Intel models it replaced, the jump in speed and efficiency is still huge. With 8GB RAM, it's still more than capable for students and everyday work, and at this price, it's easily the most affordable way to break into the MacBook lineup. $549 at Walmart

Amazon Nex Playground $249 Since the sun now sets at roughly the time my toddler finishes her after-school snack — and takes the temps down with it — we've officially entered indoor-activity season. The Nex Playground is basically a cross between a gaming console and a kid-friendly fitness system (think a modernized Nintendo Wii, minus the remotes that used to launch themselves into TV screens). It uses motion tracking to turn jumping, balancing and general wiggling into gameplay that even I enjoy, especially the two-player stuff. More than 50,000 people have picked one up in the past month, and right now it's 20% off at $199 with five games included. $249 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $250 at Target$250 at Best Buy

Black Friday FAQs

When is Black Friday this year?

Black Friday always falls on the day after Thanksgiving, which this year is Friday, Nov. 28. It used to be a one-day event, but these days, anyone calling it a single-day sale is either lying or completely out of touch. Most major retailers will roll out discounts weeks in advance — think of it as ""Black November."" That means you'll want to start keeping tabs on prices now, and who knows? You might be done with all of your holiday shopping before the turkey coma hits.

Does Black Friday have deals on everything?

Not necessarily everything, but pretty dang close. We're already seeing close to record-low prices on TVs, laptops and headphones, and it's common to see gaming consoles and appliances go on sale too.

Does every store have a sale?

Pretty much. The usual suspects — Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Macy's, Kohl's, Wayfair, The Home Depot — will all go big. Smaller brands often join in too, though some do it quietly (think: an unadvertised 20% off code hidden at checkout). Others, like REI, make a point to not have a sale with the rest of them, instead opting for earlier sales. The point is, if you're shopping online at all this fall, there's no excuse to pay full price.

How to shop Black Friday like a pro

Have a plan (or even better, a spreadsheet): Ever end up overspending while grocery shopping when you don't have a list? Me too. Don't wait until the week of Thanksgiving (or later) to decide what to buy. Create a wishlist and track prices starting now. Once that dream TV, laptop or pair of noise-cancelling headphones drops to a real all-time low, jump on it — good deals don't linger.

Do your homework: Don't rely on a single retailer. In most cases, it pays to shop around. Case in point: This past October Prime Day, Amazon had almost every single Apple device on sale, except for the brand new AirPods Pro 3, which were $249 at most retailers. I found them on sale at Sam's Club, which isn't usually first on my list when it comes to tech shopping (though the chain remains my favorite for $5 rotisserie chicken). Prices also tend to fluctuate, so don't assume the first small markdown you see is the best one.

Be skeptical: Here's a dirty little secret: Some ""sales"" aren't really sales. Retailers bump prices before big events so the discount looks steeper. Web tools like Honey or CamelCamelCamel can show you price history (to see if that 95% off gadget has ever sold at MSRP), but if you don't feel like going full spreadsheet mode, I'll be doing that work for you all month long — rounding up legit deals, not the fake ones.

The best sales to shop before Black Friday (for tech and more):

Many retailers are offering early discounts to help you get ahead of the Black Friday rush.

Why we like it: The Citi Custom Cash makes sense if you want your rewards rate to reflect your top purchases each billing cycle. With this card, you earn 5% back in your top eligible category on up to $500 each billing cycle. That means you could earn 5% back on restaurants one month and 5% back on grocery stores after that, giving you plenty of flexibility with your earning potential.

Why we like it: The U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa provides up to 5% cash back with its rewards rate, which is among the highest rates you can find on rewards credit cards. There’s a limit on how much you can earn at this rate each quarter, but it’s a reasonable cap of $2,000, especially for a no-annual-fee card. It’s also nice that you have the option to choose two 5% categories each quarter, giving you flexibility over how you earn rewards.

Should I open a 0% intro APR credit card?

It can make sense to apply for a 0% intro APR credit card for multiple reasons:

You have existing debt. You can use a 0% APR credit card as a way to help cover new purchases without accruing interest. This can give you some room in your budget to pay off existing debt. You have upcoming large purchases. You can use a 0% APR credit card to make a large purchase and then take your time (during the introductory offer period) to pay it off without interest building. This lets you hold onto cash for other necessary purchases while still making interest-free payments. It’s an emergency. This type of situation can vary, like being between jobs, but you can use a 0% APR credit card to make necessary purchases without interest accruing.

The important thing to remember is that 0% APR credit cards are still credit cards. When you use credit, you’re borrowing money from a financial institution that you have to repay, whether there’s interest or not. That means it’s still essential to responsibly use credit cards by making on-time monthly payments by the due date and not borrowing more credit than you can afford.

It’s worth noting that carrying a large balance on a credit card, even during a 0% introductory offer period, can negatively impact your credit score because of high credit utilization, or the percentage of the total amount of credit you’re using.

What to look for in a 0% intro APR credit card

0% APR offer length: In general, the longer the intro period, the better. However, the average length of 12 to 15 months should be good enough for most people before the variable APR kicks in.

Balance transfer offer: Many of the cards on this list are also balance transfer credit cards because they have 0% intro APR offers on balance transfers. You can take advantage of these offers to transfer existing debt to one of these cards and not pay interest during the offer period. You still have to cover a balance transfer fee and you can only transfer up to your available credit limit.

Annual fee: We typically only recommend paying an annual fee on a credit card if you get enough value from the card’s benefits to offset the yearly membership cost. Fortunately, the best 0% APR credit cards don’t tend to have annual fees.

Rewards program: What are you supposed to do with a 0% APR card after the offer period ends? If it’s a rewards card, you can continue using it to earn valuable points, miles, or cash back on your purchases.

Credit requirements: Many 0% APR credit cards require a good or excellent credit score to qualify, which is at least a 670 FICO score.

APR: Most credit card annual percentage rates are high, so it’s typically not best to choose between cards based on the APR unless there’s a 0% intro APR offer.

How do 0% intro APR credit cards work?

A 0% intro APR credit card lets you avoid paying interest on purchases for a set period of time. This allows you to carry a balance without worrying about racking up any interest until the end of the introductory period, though a high balance could affect your credit score and you’re still responsible for making minimum payments.

The intro period starts upon account opening and typically lasts 12 to 15 months, with some longer offers lasting 18 to 21 months.

Unlike most balance transfers, you don’t have to pay a fee to take advantage of a 0% purchase APR. However, you still want to pay off your balance before the promotional period ends. Otherwise, interest will start to accrue.

FAQs for 0% intro APR credit cards

What credit card has the longest 0% interest rate?

Credit cards with long 0% introductory APR offers include:

Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express

Chase Freedom Unlimited®

Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card

Wells Fargo Reflect® Card

Discover it® Cash Back

Citi Custom Cash® Card

Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards Credit Card

U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card

Is it worth getting a 0% APR credit card?

Getting approved for a new card with a 0% intro rate can be an excellent way to reduce credit card debt. The promotional period lets you pay your balance without worrying about interest charges, which is often better than alternative repayment strategies, such as using a credit card cash advance.

What is a good credit score for 0% APR?

You typically need good to excellent credit to qualify for a 0% APR credit card. That’s a FICO score of at least 670 and a VantageScore of at least 661. A higher credit score could improve your chances of getting approved for a 0% interest credit card.

Do no interest credit cards hurt your credit?

A 0% interest rate credit card can hurt your credit if your credit utilization is too high from carrying a high balance. You could also see a small impact on your credit score from applying for a new card. However, a 0% intro APR credit card could help with building credit over time and increasing your overall creditworthiness if you keep your card account active and make on-time payments.

Our methodology

To find the best 0% APR cards today, we started with a list of all cards from major credit card issuers that offer an introductory 0% APR, which was nearly 30 eligible credit cards. This list did not include every available card from every credit card company.

We added the cards from this list to a rubric to rate each card based on various criteria, including 0% intro APR periods, rewards, annual fees, and more.

Our final list includes highly-rated cards, based on our rubric, experience, and expert opinion, that we think could make sense for people researching 0% APR credit cards.

Given the Chase Freedom Unlimited’s high ongoing APR though, it’s important to make sure you don’t fall into old habits of racking up revolving balances. One of this card’s best features is its first-year welcome offer, for example. But if you’re not able to pay down your debt balance quickly enough to take advantage of it, or you’re worried it’ll encourage overspending that could lead you back into debt, you may want to consider another card.

Why we like it: The Blue Cash Everyday from American Express is one of our favorite cash-back credit cards today. It can also be a helpful tool for paying down existing credit card debt. The card’s introductory 0% APR on balance transfers lasts for 15 months after account opening, with a variable APR of 20.24% to 29.24% thereafter (see rates & fees). The balance transfer fee is 3% ($5 minimum) of the amount you transfer.

But the Blue Cash Everyday shines for its long-term savings once you’ve paid off your existing debt. You’ll earn 3% cash back at U.S. supermarkets, U.S. gas stations, and on U.S. online retail purchases, each up to $6,000 spent per year, then 1% back (and 1% cash back on everything else).

Perks & Benefits Long intro APR for balance transfers

Excellent option for debt payoff

Earn rewards on everyday purchases Potential drawbacks No introductory 0% APR on new purchases

Why we like it: The Citi Double Cash Card is our overall pick for anyone looking to pay down debt with a balance transfer. With a long 0% APR on balance transfers for the first 18 months (18.24%-28.24% variable APR after that), it’s an excellent option for debt payoff. You’ll pay a 3% balance transfer fee ($5 minimum) for each balance you transfer within the first four months of account opening, which increases to 5% ($5 minimum) after four months. Throughout the extended intro period, you can make major progress on existing balances or even commit to paying the amount you transfer in full.

There’s plenty to like about this card after you pay down your balance, too. You’ll earn up to 2% on every purchase you make with the Citi Double Cash: 1% when you make the purchase and 1% when you pay it off. That rewards structure may even add some incentive to avoid carrying a balance once you’ve paid down your debt, since you won’t earn the total cash rewards until you pay in full.

Unlike other balance transfer credit cards, the Citi Double Cash Card does not offer an introductory 0% APR on new purchases — the only detail that kept it from a perfect score in our methodology. However, if you’re planning to use this card primarily to pay down debt (and then for its cash-back benefits after the intro period), we don’t think that holds this card back from being a top choice among balance transfer offers today.

Perks & Benefits Rewards are rounded up

Lower balance transfer fee than other cards Potential drawbacks Rewards spend cap for some categories

Why we like it: The Citi Rewards+ Card is another rewards credit card with a solid 15-month introductory 0% APR period, which applies to both new purchases and balance transfers. After the intro period ends, you’ll pay a 17.74%-27.74% variable APR. That’s still very high for any balance you carry, but it is one of the lowest you’ll find among balance transfer credit cards today.

After the intro period ends, you can earn Citi ThankYou® Points on your purchases: 5x points on hotels, rental cars, and attractions booked through Citi Travel through the end of 2025; 2x points at supermarkets and gas stations (up to the first $6,000 spent per year, then 1x); and 1x on all other purchases. For each purchase you make, your rewards are rounded up to the nearest 10 — so you could get 30 points from a $24 purchase — and for each redemption you make, you’ll get 10% points back (up to the first 100,000 points you redeem per year). Each of these can help you maximize points to use on travel, statement credits, gift cards, and more.

The Citi Rewards+ Card isn’t the only rewards card from Citi with a competitive intro period and a lower ongoing APR, but it took the edge over the potentially higher-earning Citi Custom Cash® Card for its slightly lower balance transfer fee. When you transfer a balance to the Citi Rewards+ within the first four months of account opening, you’ll pay a 3% fee ($5 minimum). After that, the fee goes up to 5% of your transfer ($5 minimum), which is the same as the Citi Custom Cash Card’s fee.

Recommended credit score Good to Excellent Rewards rate 5% cash back on everyday purchases at different places each quarter — including grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, and more — up to the quarterly maximum 1% unlimited cash back on all other purchases



Why we like it: Discover it Cash Back similarly offers great ongoing rewards alongside a useful 0% APR. It has an introductory 0% APR period for 15 months after account opening for new purchases and balance transfers (as long as you make your transfer within a given time period). The ongoing variable APR after the intro period is 18.24%-27.24%, and there’s a standard balance transfer fee that’s in line with other balance transfer credit cards.

The Discover it Cash Back also has great long-term value with revolving 5% cash back Discover rewards categories. You’ll earn 5% back on the first $1,500 spent across the revolving categories — which may include grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, streaming services, and more — each quarter when you activate and 1% on everything else.

Like some other cards on our list, one of the Discover it Cash Back card’s top features is its welcome offer: a Cashback Match on all the rewards you earn in your first year. Of course, maximizing this offer depends on earning rewards on your purchases throughout the year. If you want to take advantage of the bonus offer (and the card’s revolving bonus rewards categories), make sure you can balance your spending with your debt payoff plan so you don’t end up back where you started when the balance transfer intro period ends.

Purchase APR 15.24% - 25.24% variable Rewards rate None Benefits No annual fee No penalty APR (paying late won't automatically raise your interest rate; other account pricing and terms apply)



Why we like it: BankAmericard has a solid combination of long introductory 0% APR and relatively low ongoing APR, which can be great for people solely focused on debt payoff. The introductory period for balance transfers is 18 billing cycles and applies to balances you transfer within 60 days of account opening. The same 0% APR intro period applies for new purchases. After that, you’ll pay a variable 15.24%-25.24% APR on any remaining balance. While that can easily add up over time, it’s significantly less than you’ll find from many credit cards today.

There’s an introductory balance transfer fee of 3% for the first 60 days, then it goes up to 4%. There’s also no penalty APR; while you should always make your credit card payment on time (especially while carrying a balance), paying late or having a payment returned won’t automatically increase your BankAmericard APR.

Why we like it: The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card is an excellent choice for balance transfers primarily because of its extraordinarily long 0% APR offer of 21 months. This feature allows cardholders to transfer existing balances and enjoy a prolonged period without incurring interest, providing ample time for debt management and reduction.

The 5% balance transfer fee needs to be considered, but for many, the benefit of the extended interest-free period outweighs this cost. This card is particularly advantageous for those who anticipate needing more time to pay off their balances and want to avoid the rapid accumulation of interest charges.

That intro offer applies to new purchases and to balance transfers made within 60 days of account opening. After that, your remaining balances will earn a variable 17.74%-28.74% APR.

Welcome offer None

Card type(s) Balance transfer

Introductory APR 0% intro APR on new purchases for 12 months and balance transfers for 21 months (variable 18.24% - 28.99% after that)

Purchase APR 18.24% - 28.99% variable Rewards rate Low intro APR on balance transfers Low intro APR on purchases

Benefits No late fees $0 liability on unauthorized charges



Why we like it: The primary appeal of the Citi Simplicity Card for balance transfers lies in its extended 0% APR offer, lasting an impressive 21 months. This length of time is one of the longest available, providing cardholders with a substantial period to manage and pay off transferred balances without accruing interest.

The 0% APR offer for 12 months on purchases also adds flexibility, allowing cardholders to make new purchases without immediate interest concerns. While the card does not offer cash-back rewards or a welcome bonus, its strength is its simplicity and the potential for significant interest savings.

The balance transfer fee of $5 or 3%, whichever is greater, is a standard rate and should be considered when evaluating the overall benefit of transferring balances to this card. The Citi Simplicity Card is particularly well-suited for those prioritizing a lengthy interest-free period for their balance transfer needs, offering a straightforward and cost-effective approach to managing debt.

How do balance transfer credit cards work?

Not only is credit card interest expensive, but it’s as high as it’s ever been. Today’s average credit card interest rate is over 21% — higher than at any other point since the Federal Reserve began tracking rates in the 1990s. For those who carry a balance on their card, the average is more than 23%.

Credit cards with 0% APR on balance transfers can offer significant savings compared to standard double-digit interest rates.

Maximize your balance transfer savings by paying your balance in full before the intro period ends. If you can’t pay the balance within the 0% APR period, you can still shave months and potentially thousands of dollars from your debt payoff.

Your total savings will depend on a few details, including the length of your intro period and how much you can pay each month.

Balance transfer example

Let’s say you have a credit card balance of $5,500 today — just below the average balance for U.S. households with credit card debt, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. That balance is all on a credit card earning 21% APR. Here’s what your journey to pay down debt could look like over a few different scenarios:

Minimum payments: This is by far the most costly option. Making only minimum payments, you would add nearly $9,000 in interest over more than two decades before paying your balance off in full. Total paid: $14,499

Fixed monthly payment: You can minimize costs by paying more than your monthly minimum, even if you cannot pay your balance in full. Maybe you can afford to contribute a fixed payment of $200 each month toward your debt. In this case, you’ll pay your balance in full after three years, but still add more than $2,000 to your total balance. Total paid: $7,566

Now, let’s see how a balance transfer credit card could make a difference in your $5,500 debt. This card comes with an 18-month 0% introductory APR and a 3% balance transfer fee (more on that below). After the intro period, you’ll take on the same 21% APR.

Pay in full: If you can put at least $314 toward your credit card bill each month, you could wipe out your balance in full by the end of the intro period without paying any additional interest. The only payment added to your principal is the 3% fee when you transfer, equal to $165. Total paid: $5,665

Fixed monthly payment: If the amount you need to pay in full is out of your budget, you can still save with a balance transfer offer. Maybe you can afford the same $200 monthly payment as before the transfer. Over the introductory period, you would pay down $3,600 of your principal balance, lowering your debt to $2,065. Once the APR starts to accrue, you could cover the remainder in one year with only $235 in added interest. Transferring your balance would allow you to pay your balance in full over 30 months and with about $400 in added interest and fees. Total paid: $5,900

What to look for in a balance transfer card

There are many factors to consider for a balance transfer credit card, most notably whether this is the right tool to help with your debt repayment journey. Make sure you're considering balance transfer credit cards that match your financial goals. Here are a few details to look for:

Introductory APR: Credit cards offer introductory APRs for new cardholders, either on new purchases or balance transfers (or both). The introductory rate for many balance transfer cards is 0% over a given intro period, which can help you pay down your existing balance without interest.

Regular APR: APR stands for annual percentage rate, the percentage you get charged by the credit lender each payment period you carry a balance. This will likely be different than your intro rate. Credit cards typically have variable APRs, which means your rate goes up and down over time.

Transfer period: On some cards, balance transfers are only eligible for 0% APR offers when you transfer your balance within a given time frame: within 60 days of account opening or 120 days of account opening, for example. While it makes sense to transfer your debt as soon as possible to take advantage of the full intro period, you’ll also want to keep any time limits like this in mind, so you don’t miss out on the offer.

Issuer: You generally won’t be able to transfer a balance from one card account to another card account with the same bank. Look for balance transfer offers from different credit card issuers than the card on which you have an existing debt balance.

Annual fees: Your issuing bank might charge an annual fee for your card, though annual fees aren’t common among top balance transfer cards. If you do choose a card with an annual fee, you should make sure you’re getting enough value to offset the yearly cost.

Balance transfer fees: If you want to transfer debt to an existing balance from one credit card to another, the new card issuer can charge you a fee. This is usually a percentage of your transfer amount ranging from 3% to 5% with at least a $5 minimum.

Your credit score: Balance transfer credit cards generally require a good credit score. A credit score is a number that represents your credit health, and is based on the information in your credit report. You can request a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) These reports contain your credit history, like how many credit card accounts you've had. Credit scores range from 300-850. Above around 700 is considered good, and above 800 is considered excellent — the higher your score, the more likely you are to qualify for great loan terms and rewarding credit cards in the future.

Balance transfer credit card costs and fees

A balance transfer credit card can save you money, but you should still prepare for the potential costs you’ll incur.

Balance transfer cards don’t typically carry an annual fee. However, there is often a fee for transferring your balance. Balance transfer fees can range from 3%-5% of your overall balance, usually with a minimum of around $5 or $10.

Say you want to transfer a $3,000 balance to a card with a 0% intro APR and a 3% balance transfer fee. The balance transfer would cost you $90 in total. The larger your balance, the more you’ll pay for the balance transfer. Still, these fees are likely only a small fraction of the interest you would otherwise pay.

Some balance transfer credit cards waive this fee. If you have a very high balance that could lead to a costly fee — or you want to avoid any added cost altogether — you may want to focus on balance transfer cards with no fee.

Balance transfer credit card pros and cons

Balance transfers have pros and cons. While benefits include the intro APR offer for debt payoff, cons include balance transfer fees and potentially few.

Pros

0% introductory APR: With no-interest balance transfer credit cards, any payments you make throughout the intro period will go directly toward your principal balance. Instead of interest making it more challenging to pay off your debt, you can use this tool to eliminate the underlying balance.

No annual fee: The best balance transfer cards available today have no annual fee, so you don’t have to worry about any additional cost of owning the card.

Debt consolidation: If you have balances spread across multiple credit cards, you may be able to consolidate them onto a single balance transfer card. Not only can you benefit from the period of interest-free payments, but you’ll also minimize the number of individual monthly payments you need to remember. Just make sure the total transferred balance is less than your card’s credit limit.

Cons

Risk of not paying your balance off in full: You may not be able to maximize your balance transfer if you cannot prioritize your monthly payments over the intro period. These cards work best if you can commit to paying down a significant portion of your balance over the 0% APR offer. Otherwise, you’ll be left with a growing balance once again when your regular interest rate begins.

Balance transfer fees: The fees issuers charge to make your transfer can add to your overall balance. But for most cardholders, a 3% or 5% fee will still be far less than the amount you would otherwise accrue in interest charges.

Credit limits: Make sure you know the credit limit of your balance transfer credit card before you attempt to make your transfer. If your existing debt is more than the limit, you won’t be able to transfer the entire balance.

3 ways to maximize your balance transfer credit card

Take advantage of your new card. Not only is a balance transfer credit card a great way to pay down debt, but it can also set you up for a better financial future. Here are three things you should do when you open up a new card:

1. Make the most of your introductory 0% APR

The introductory period on your balance transfer card only lasts so long. Take full advantage by transferring your balance as soon as possible after approval. If your new credit card offers an 18-month 0% APR intro period but you wait two months to make your transfer, paying down your debt in that shorter time frame will be more difficult.

Some balance transfer cards even require you to transfer your balance within a specific timeframe. For example, your card agreement may specify that the 0% APR offer applies to transfers made within the first 30 days of account opening. Alternatively, you could take on a more significant balance transfer fee the longer you wait. For example, there may only be a 3% fee for balances transferred within 60 days of account opening, but a 5% fee for balances transferred after that time.

Always read the fine print of an introductory balance transfer offer before opening your account so you can avoid any surprises that may set you back.

2. Focus on debt payoff

Throughout the intro period, prioritize paying down your debt without making new purchases that increase your balance. If you’re adding to your balance throughout the 0% APR period, you’ll only leave yourself with more to pay off.

Instead, focus on buying only what you can afford to pay in full. Whether you make purchases with another credit card, use your debit card, or pay with cash, ensure you have enough money in the bank to cover your spending.

This may also help you become more aware of any spending habits that led to taking on the debt in the first place, so you can avoid ending up in the same place again.

3. Think about the long-term

If debt payoff is your priority, long-term rewards or benefits may not be the biggest concern when choosing your balance transfer card, but they are worth considering.

Balance transfer credit cards with the longest introductory 0% APR periods (up to 21 months) typically offer few ongoing benefits. They are designed for cardholders looking to pay off as much debt as possible over a more extended period.

On the other hand, credit cards with balance transfer offers and ongoing rewards or other benefits tend to have slightly shorter intro periods of around 12 to 15 months. Even after you pay down your debt, these cards can offer long-term value on your everyday purchases. Just make sure you plan to avoid overspending and taking on debt again.

Should I open a balance transfer card?

Only you can decide if opening a new account is right for you. A balance transfer credit card can help if you're in debt or have high-interest debt. But you should always consider all the options that could help you pay down debt balances and know the potential risks involved. Think about these things before you make your decision:

Alternative options

A balance transfer isn’t your only option for debt payoff. Consolidating debt with a personal loan may be a better option for some people.

If your debt far exceeds the credit limit on a new balance transfer card or you need more time than 0% APR intro periods offer today, opting for a personal loan with a fixed APR lower than your current credit card could be a good solution.

Credit impact

Not only do you need good credit to qualify for a balance transfer card, but a balance transfer itself can also potentially affect your credit.

For one, when you open any new credit card (including a balance transfer card), the required hard inquiry on your credit could lead to a small, temporary credit score drop. To keep multiple applications from sinking your score, only apply for cards you’re confident you’ll qualify for or get prequalified before applying.

Another potential credit impact involves your credit limit. If you transfer a debt balance that makes up nearly your entire credit line, you could increase your credit utilization ratio — the amount of credit you’re using compared to the amount you have available. This is one of the most influential factors in your credit score; the lower it is, the better. However, if you can keep up with your payments and begin to quickly bring down your balance over the intro period, you can mitigate the negative effect and balance the ratio.

Develop a plan

A good plan is the most important thing you can have before opening a balance transfer credit card.

Using your card details (length of intro period, balance transfer fee, etc.), determine precisely how much you need to pay each month to eliminate your balance in full before the 0% APR period ends. If necessary, look at your budget and spending before you apply to find areas where you can reduce spending to dedicate more toward your monthly payments.

If you can't pay off your balance completely, think about what next steps you’ll take once interest kicks in to keep the remainder from growing out of your control.

And don’t forget to rethink your spending over the long term to ensure you don’t wind up with another debt balance in the future. Practicing good credit habits and spending only what you can afford is the best way to take advantage of the rewards and benefits of credit cards without paying the price tag of high interest rates.

Balance transfer FAQ

Are balance transfer credit cards worth it?

Balance transfer cards can be a savvy financial move if you're looking to tackle high-interest debt. By transferring your existing debt to a card with a 0% introductory APR, you stop accruing interest and only make payments toward the principal balance.

However, if you can't clear the balance before the introductory period ends, you'll face the card's standard APR on the remainder. You should be confident you can make a significant difference in your balance before this ongoing interest kicks in to make the balance transfer worth it. It's also important to note that most balance transfer credit cards come with a transfer fee — usually 3%-5% of the amount transferred — which adds to your costs.

What is the smartest way to do a balance transfer?

Navigating a balance transfer can be tricky; you need a solid strategy to maximize it.

First, find a balance transfer card that offers a long 0% introductory APR period — ideally, 15 to 21 months. The longer this no-interest period lasts, the more time you have to pay down your balance without worrying about interest charges. Also pay attention to the balance transfer fee; most balance transfer cards will have at least a 3% fee that you should be prepared to add to your total amount due.

Once you’ve opened your new card, transfer the balances from your highest-interest credit cards first to maximize savings over the 0% APR period. Double-check your balance transfer limit before you start so you don’t attempt to transfer more than the card allows.

Prioritize paying more than the minimum payment each month. To truly take advantage of the 0% APR, calculate how much you must pay monthly to clear the debt before the introductory period ends. If you just stick to the minimum, you likely won’t reduce the balance by much.

Never make a late payment on your balance transfer card. One missed payment could mean losing your 0% APR and being hit with a much higher penalty APR, along with late fees. Set up autopay or reminders to ensure you never miss a due date.

Avoid using your new card for new purchases while you pay down the balance. Keep your spending in check and focus solely on paying off the debt you transferred.

Finally, don’t get caught off guard when the 0% APR period expires. If you think you won’t be able to pay off the full balance by then, start planning ahead for how you’ll continue paying down your debt.

Do balance transfers hurt your credit score?

A balance transfer can temporarily lower your credit score because it triggers a hard inquiry by the card issuer on your credit report. This is true for all new credit applications, not just balance transfer cards.

A balance transfer can also affect your credit utilization ratio, potentially lowering your score if the balance transferred to your new card represents a large percentage of its limit. Credit utilization, which measures how much credit you’re using compared to your total available credit, is a major factor in calculating your credit score. your credit score. It’s best to keep this ratio under 30%.

The good news is that if you use a balance transfer card wisely — by paying down your balance and avoiding more debt — your credit score should improve over time.

What credit score is typically required to get an ideal balance transfer credit card?

Like most credit cards, the higher your score is, the better your chances of getting the best available balance transfer offers with long 0% APR periods and other benefits.

In general, you’re most likely to qualify for a balance transfer card with a good-to-excellent credit score. According to FICO, that means a score of at least 670 and up to the maximum 850 credit score. With a solid credit score (especially one closer to the “excellent” end of the range around 750 or higher), you can usually score the best balance transfer terms, a relatively lower interest rate after the intro period, and additional perks like cash-back rewards and a sign-up bonus.

Our methodology

To create our list of the best balance transfer credit cards, we prioritized a holistic look at what these cards offer cardholders, even after the intro period ends.

First and foremost, though, we analyzed the details of each card’s balance transfer offer. This includes the length of the intro period for balance transfers, the balance transfer fee, and whether it also has an intro period for new purchases. We also rated each card on other features that may apply throughout the intro period and beyond: the ongoing variable APR, any rewards on spending, annual fee cost, and credit score access.

Finally, we reviewed customer service, security, and accessibility features that apply to any of our card rankings. These include mobile app reviews, fraud monitoring, number of ways to contact the issuer, and more.

Using this system, we evaluated more than two dozen credit cards from major issuers with balance transfer offers available today. The cards we looked at are widely available for American consumers (with the credit to qualify), no matter where you’re located or what institution you bank with.

Of course, not everyone looking for a balance transfer credit card is interested in long-term rewards and benefits. For some, finding the longest intro period available to begin paying down debt is more important than any ongoing card features. While the cards with today’s longest intro periods (typically 18 to 21 months) generally scored lower in our overall ranking system because of their lack of ongoing value, we did want to include them on our list.

In the “more cards to consider” section, we include these cards, which offer the longest introductory periods and next-best overall scores after those cards that made the primary list.to bring down your balance over the intro period quickly

But if your regular budget is often focused across these rewards categories, the sky is the limit on how many points you can earn annually with this card.

Citi Strata Premier is also great for hotel rewards, especially if you’re not committed to a single hotel loyalty program and can use the issuer’s booking portal.

How do rewards credit cards work?

A good credit card with rewards that suit your spending can help you save money on daily expenses, earn free or discounted travel, and get annual benefits that put money back into your pocket year after year.

The best credit card with the best rewards for you should always offer valuable incentives — points, miles, or cash-back rewards and other benefits — for the money you're already spending.

You could, for example, earn rewards on everyday spending and keep redemptions simple by using cash-back rewards. But if you're a jet-setter and don’t mind strategizing redemption options, you may prefer to earn points or miles you can use for future flights and hotel stays. Or, like many spenders, you might instead do a little bit of both and use different credit cards for maximizing purchases.

Just remember that your rewards card is still a high-interest credit card. Earning great rewards only works if you’re not carrying a balance — which can quickly lead to expensive credit card debt.

Find a card that rewards your regular purchases and track your budget so you don’t overspend each month. You can save a lot of money with rewards, but only if it’s not costing you in interest at the same time.

3 types of credit card rewards

To find the best rewards credit card for you, you can start with the types of rewards, how to earn them, and the most valuable ways to use them.

Credit card rewards programs differ depending on the issuer and specific card you choose. Some may offer the same value for any redemption (gift cards, cash, travel, etc.), while others may give a much higher value for one redemption over another. Always read the terms of your card’s rewards program to know what you can get for each redemption.

The three most common types of credit card rewards include points, miles, and cash back:

Points

Credit cards that earn points are often part of a larger rewards program, such as American Express Membership Rewards or Chase Ultimate Rewards. You can earn at least one point per dollar on every purchase with your card, then get extra points in specific bonus categories. These categories may range from various travel spending to dining out, streaming services, and more.

Points are a flexible rewards currency. You can often redeem them for statement credits, booking travel, gift cards, and more. Some rewards programs even allow you to transfer your points to travel partner loyalty programs. Many points-earning cards are travel rewards credit cards, so you’ll often find travel redemptions are most valuable.

Best for: Credit card points are great if you want the most flexibility in how you redeem your rewards — they’re particularly beneficial if you prefer a range of redemption options rather than being restricted to cash back or specific travel brands. Cards with points rewards are also generally good for travelers, since they tend to offer great earning rates and redemptions on travel.

How to earn credit card points

Sign-up bonuses: Many credit cards offer lucrative bonuses for new cardholders after spending a certain amount within the first few months.

Regular purchases: Cardholders typically earn points for every dollar they spend on eligible purchases.

Bonus categories: Some cards offer higher point rates for specific categories, like travel, dining, streaming subscriptions, or gas stations.

Shopping portals: Many credit card issuers have online shopping portals where users can earn extra points by shopping with partner retailers.

Dining programs: Some card issuers have dining reward programs that give extra miles when you dine at partner restaurants.

Special promotions: Occasionally, issuers might run promotions or partnerships where cardholders can earn additional points for a limited time.

Miles

General travel cards with flexible rewards or co-branded cards for specific airline loyalty programs may earn miles rewards. They often earn the best rewards rates on travel spending, though you’ll find many with everyday bonus categories too. You can typically redeem miles for travel expenses, including airfare. If your miles-earning card is an airline card, you may have the option to use your rewards for upgrades, checked bags, lounge access, and other benefits.

Best for: Credit card miles are ideal for frequent travelers. They cater to individuals who are looking to offset their travel expenses and enjoy travel perks like elite airline status, airport lounge access, priority boarding, and free checked bags. Because many cards that earn miles are co-branded airline cards, they’re a good choice for travelers who prefer flying with a specific brand each time.

How to earn credit card miles

Sign-up bonuses: Many miles-based credit cards offer a sizable chunk of miles as a bonus for new users who meet a certain spending threshold after opening an account.

Everyday purchases: Typically, cardholders earn a set number of miles for every dollar they spend.

Travel-related expenses: Many travel credit cards offer additional miles for expenses related to travel, like booking flights, hotels, or car rentals. Sometimes these bonus rewards require booking through a specific platform.

Promotional campaigns: Issuers may run limited-time offers where spending in certain categories or with certain partners can yield bonus miles.

Related: How to earn elite airline status with a credit card

Cash back

Cash back may be the most straightforward form of credit card rewards. Cash-back credit cards offer a percentage of each purchase you make back as a reward. Rewards categories generally focus on everyday spending, like grocery stores, gas stations, drugstores, or streaming services. When you’re ready to redeem your cash back, you can trade it for a statement credit or receive the cash value as a check or bank account deposit.

Best for: Cash-back credit cards are ideal for simple rewards and a tangible, immediate return on your spending. They are especially beneficial for those who may not travel frequently and prefer a clear-cut, monetary reward over points or miles.

How to earn cash back

Sign-up bonuses: Some cash-back cards offer a bonus cash reward for new users who spend a specific amount within the first few months.

Everyday purchases: Cardholders earn a defined percentage back on all qualifying purchases.

Category-specific rewards: Many cash-back cards offer higher percentages for specific categories, such as groceries, gas, or dining.

Rotating categories: Some cards offer higher cash-back rates on categories that change periodically, requiring cardholders to activate these categories to earn the bonus.

Shopping through issuer portals: Similar to points-based cards, some cash-back cards allow users to earn additional rewards by shopping through the issuer's online portal with partner retailers.

Should I open a rewards credit card?

Whether or not you should open a rewards card depends on your individual goals.

If you don’t already have great credit, you may have difficulty qualifying for the best rewards credit cards — though there are some solid rewards cards you can get approved for while building credit. Check if you’re preapproved before you apply for a new card. This can give you an idea of your likelihood of approval without impacting your credit score.

Related: How to check your credit score

You should also be in the habit of paying down your balances in full and on time each month before you open a new rewards credit card. These cards carry high interest rates — you might be assigned an APR of 20% or more on any balances you carry.

Even with the best rewards rates and redemptions, you won’t be able to make up those interest charges in rewards value. Always use your rewards card to make purchases within your budget so you’re not left with high debt balances in exchange for points, miles, or cash back.

Finally, make sure a rewards credit card can actually help you save money over the long term.

Review your monthly expenses to identify where you spend the most, whether it’s at the grocery store, dining out at restaurants, filling up at gas stations, or booking travel. When you know your most frequent expenses, you can choose a card that rewards those specific categories more generously.

A high-value welcome bonus or long introductory APR can save you a lot of money as a new cardholder. But don’t forget to compare these perks alongside long-term benefits and rewards to ensure you’re getting the most from your new rewards credit card year after year.

What to look for in a rewards credit card

Start your search for the best rewards credit card by considering these eight major factors:

Annual fee

Some rewards credit cards charge no annual fee, while others may have fees ranging from under $100 to over $500. You may also find some rewards credit cards waive the annual fee cost for the first year.

The point isn’t the fee itself. The one question you need to ask is: ""Will the benefits I get offset the cost?""

Other fees

In addition to the annual fee, stay on top of any other fees you could take on with your new rewards credit card.

For example, if you plan to use your card to earn rewards on vacation abroad, make sure there are no foreign transaction fees. These fees could add between 1% to 3% on top of each international purchase and lower the value of any rewards you’ll earn.

Other fees to consider include balance transfer fees, late fees and penalties, cash advance fees, and more. Knowing when you may be charged these fees — and how you can avoid them — can help you avoid extra charges over time.

Earning potential

Before applying for a new card, know how much you can expect to earn with it over time. You can do this by comparing your regular spending to the rewards offered.

For example, if you're researching a flat-rate 1.5% unlimited cash-back card and you spend roughly $500 on purchases each week, here's what your approximate annual return will be:

$500 per week x 52 weeks = $26,000 in annual spending

$26,000 x .015 (1.5% cash back) = $390 cash rewards

Spending categories

While some rewards credit cards offer blanket points, miles, and cash back for every purchase, not all of them do. Some have tiered programs where you earn more in one category and less in another. For example, say Credit Card X offers the following spending categories:

5x points on gas and grocery store purchases

3x points on dining and takeout

1x points on everything else

If you often cook at home and commute to work by car, this could be a great way to make the most of your frequent grocery trips and gas station fill-ups. On the other hand, if you prefer dining at restaurants or ordering takeout over buying groceries and you take public transportation to work, there’s likely a different rewards card that's a better fit for your spending.

Welcome bonus

Credit card welcome bonuses can help you earn hundreds of dollars in rewards value as a new cardholder. If you have a cash-back credit card, you’ll typically get a cash bonus after meeting a spending threshold. For credit cards that earn points or miles, you’ll earn bonus rewards you can put toward travel and other redemption options after you meet the spending requirement.

Here's the potential downside:

You usually have to spend a certain amount within a given time frame to receive the bonus (example: spend $500 in the first 3 months and receive $200 cash back).

If you fail to make your payments on time or don't spend the required amount during the introductory window, you forfeit the bonus.

Redemptions

The value of your credit card rewards depends a lot on the available redemptions. Don’t forget to compare your card’s redemption options alongside its rewards categories. A good rule of thumb is to look for a redemption value of at least 1 cent per point or mile. This is equivalent to the value of cash back rewards.

But you can get much more than that with many rewards cards. For example, some offer a boosted value for your points or miles when you use them to book travel via the issuer’s credit card rewards program. Top credit card rewards programs today include American Express Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, and Capital One Travel.

Another way to get the best value is by transferring your rewards. You can transfer the points you earn from your rewards card to airline and hotel partners, then redeem through those loyalty programs. Depending on your travel plans, this is a great way to get the maximum value toward a future trip.

Intro APR offers

Introductory 0% APR offers can give you a free pass from interest charges on your card balances throughout the intro period. The 0% APR applies to new purchases or balance transfers (or both). But keep the end date of your offer in mind. Once the intro period expires, you'll start to accrue interest on any outstanding balances at your card’s ongoing APR.

The average credit card APR today is over 22% (on cards with revolving balances), according to the Federal Reserve. Make sure you have a plan to pay down your balances before the intro period ends so you can avoid taking on any high interest debts.

Credit score

For the best chances of getting approved for a rewards credit card, you’ll need to meet some criteria that proves your creditworthiness to credit lenders:

A higher-than-average credit score (exceptional in some cases)

An established credit history (proving that you can use credit responsibly)

That being said, don't waste a hard credit inquiry on a card that is presumably out of your credit realm. For example, if you’re a beginner with no established credit, you'll have a much better chance of getting a student credit card or a secured credit card than a high annual fee premium travel card.

Some credit card companies offer preapprovals on select cards, which you can use to avoid a potential (temporary) hit to your credit. This will let you know if you have a good chance of getting approved without a hard credit inquiry.

How to calculate credit card rewards

You can earn rewards with every swipe of your credit card, but how much? These are the five steps you can apply to almost any transaction:

Identify the reward rate: Check your credit card's terms and conditions. For example, the rewards rate could be 2% flat cash back for every purchase.

Determine the purchase amount: This would be the total amount you spent. Let's say your bill was $100.

Multiply the purchase amount by the reward rate: $100 x 0.02 = $2.

Consider any caps or limits: Some cards have a maximum reward limit per month or year. Ensure your calculated reward doesn't exceed this limit.

Keep in mind, some transactions won't earn credit card rewards, including:

Balance transfers/balance transfer fees

Cash advances

Lottery tickets or casino gaming chips

Interest payments

Fees of any kind, including an annual fee

Unauthorized or fraudulent charges

How to redeem credit card rewards

There's no shortage of ways to redeem your credit card points. Though redemptions vary depending on the specific card and issuer, here are some of the most common options:

Statement credit: This is a credit for the value of your rewards applied directly to your credit card balance. Some rewards cards only apply statement credits to specific types of purchases, like travel spending.

Direct deposit into your bank account: Transfer the cash value of your rewards directly into a linked bank account.

A check: You’ll receive a check in the mail for the cash value of your rewards, which you can deposit into a bank account or cash.

Gift cards: Trade your rewards for preloaded cards that you can use for purchases at specific retailers or a group of retailers.

Tickets to events: Use your rewards for access to concerts, sporting events, and more.

Charitable donations: Put your rewards toward a monetary contribution to a nonprofit organization or cause.

Travel: Book flights, hotels, rental cars, and more using credit card points and miles through your credit card rewards program.

Travel upgrades: You can also use rewards to enhance your travel experiences by upgrading a flight seat or getting a room upgrade at a hotel.

Travel transfers: Transfer your points or miles to partner hotel and airline loyalty programs and book travel directly.

Rewards credit cards FAQs

Want to know more about choosing the best credit card with rewards that fit your spending? The answers to these frequently asked questions may help:

What is a rewards credit card?

A rewards credit card is a type of card that earns cash back, points, or miles on purchases.

Some rewards cards offer a flat rewards rate on every purchase, while others have boosted bonus rewards rates in specific categories. Rewards categories can vary, but often cover a range of everyday spending (groceries, dining, gas, streaming services) or travel (airfare, hotel stays, rideshares, car rentals).

What is the best credit card for rewards?

To find out what credit card has the best rewards, you’ll need to look at your own spending and preferences.

For example, a cash-back rewards credit card like the Blue Cash Preferred from American Express may be best for someone who spends a lot of their budget at U.S. supermarkets, while the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card may work better for someone with variable spending who likes to travel. A co-branded travel rewards card may be ideal for someone who has one preferred airline or hotel, while the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card could be a better option for someone who wants different travel booking options through a flexible rewards program.

Before you decide on a new rewards card, think about your spending habits, how you want to redeem rewards, and other card details to find the option that holds the maximum value for you over time.

What credit score do I need to get a rewards credit card?

Rewards credit cards typically require good-to-excellent credit (or a FICO score of at least 670) for the best chances of approval. This is true for top cash-back credit cards, travel credit cards, and other popular rewards credit cards. If you don’t already have a great credit score, there are some cards for building credit that offer some rewards.

Read more about today’s best secured credit cards and best student credit cards for a look at credit-building cards with rewards.

What are the best sign-up bonuses for rewards credit cards available right now?

With today’s best credit card welcome offers, you can earn hundreds of dollars in rewards value. Some premium cards even have welcome bonuses with a potential value of $1,000 or more. In addition to ongoing sign-up bonuses, you can occasionally find boosted, limited-time credit card welcome offers too.

Are rewards cards really worth it?

Rewards credit cards are worth it if you can get more value from the card’s benefits and rewards than you pay for the annual fee.

If you choose a card with rewards and benefits for purchases you already make, you can often far outpace the annual fee cost in rewards value. For some people, a rewards card with no annual fee at all may be even more worth it.

However, rewards cards are often not worth it if you carry a balance. Even the best credit card rewards can't compete with interest charges well over 20% APR. Focus on paying down existing credit card debt before you use a new rewards credit card to save on spending.

How much are credit card rewards points worth?

The value of your points can vary depending on your card’s rewards program and the redemption option you choose.

For example, cash-back credit cards typically earn a percentage of your purchase back, which you can redeem for the cash value in the form of statement credits, gift cards, or a check. But credit cards that earn points or miles often have more flexible redemption options. Under the issuer’s rewards program, your points might be worth more toward travel than if you use them for statement credits. If there’s an option to transfer your rewards to travel partners, that could boost your value even more.

In general, a good way to make sure you’re getting a good value for your points is to aim for at least 1 cent per point when you redeem.

Are credit card rewards taxable?

Credit card rewards are generally considered rebates on your spending, so you don’t need to pay taxes on your points, miles, or cash back. However, there are a few exceptions, including referral bonuses and other rewards that don’t require you to spend anything to earn them.

If you’re not sure whether you owe taxes on the rewards you earn, make sure you speak with a tax professional before you file your return.

Our methodology

To find the best rewards credit cards available today, we compiled a list of cards from major issuers that earn either cash back, points, or miles rewards. This list is made up of general rewards cards. It does not include credit cards for small business owners, co-branded travel credit cards, and secured or student credit cards.

This allowed us to focus on the most valuable rewards options for the broadest range of cardholders. In total, we compared more than three dozen rewards credit cards for this list.

To compare rewards value, we looked at both how you earn rewards and how you redeem them. The cards with the most flexibility — multiple ways to earn, higher rewards multipliers, different redemption options — were ranked highest. We also evaluated any annual benefits and the value of the card’s welcome bonus compared to its annual fee cost.

We gave additional points to cards with no foreign transaction fees and with 0% APR offers for new purchases. These are valuable benefits no matter what type of rewards card you have. For one, eliminating foreign transaction fees helps guarantee the full value of your rewards when traveling abroad. And a 0% APR offer can add first-year value for new cardholders. You’ll get the option to pay down a large expense — like a vacation booking or a home improvement project — over time while earning rewards.

From there, we evaluated the factors we look for in any credit card. These include each card’s ongoing APR, annual fee, mobile app experience, customer service options, and fraud prevention. The final picks on the list above are the top-ranking cards from this rubric that we believe can add value to anyone’s wallet and spending over the long term.

More travel credit cards to consider

General travel cards like the ones above can be great for scoring points and miles toward any type of travel. But if you always prefer flying with a certain airline or booking with a specific hotel chain, a co-branded travel card might be more rewarding.

We included hotel and airline cards in our overall travel card ratings, and the cards below are the top-scoring options.

Just remember: a co-branded travel card only makes sense if you fly often enough with that airline or stay frequently enough at the hotel to justify its value over a more general card. Make sure you look at your recent travel and any upcoming plans before deciding.

3 ways to use travel credit cards to save on holiday trip expenses

1. Earn rewards

The points or miles you earn with travel credit cards can be redeemed toward expensive trip costs, such as flights and hotel stays.

In general, there are two primary ways to earn rewards with a travel credit card:

Earn a generous welcome offer as a new cardholder Earn rewards on everyday purchases

Qualifying for a sign-up bonus can significantly boost your earning potential as a new rewards cardholder, so it’s essential that you meet the terms and conditions of the bonus.

For example, many welcome bonuses require you to spend a certain amount of money on your card within the first few months of card membership. If you don’t typically spend thousands of dollars over the course of three months, consider timing your card application for when you know you have large, upcoming purchases.

To earn the most rewards possible on everyday purchases, consider travel credit cards with categories that align with your typical spending habits. For instance, if you eat out a lot, a card that rewards you with bonus points or miles on dining may make sense.

2. Use travel benefits

Various travel card perks and benefits can help lower your overall trip costs and make life easier as you travel. These could include airport lounge access, travel credits, free checked bags, and more.

The most beneficial perks for you depend on your travel habits and preferences. If you frequently fly throughout the year, just having a checked bag benefit could save you hundreds of dollars annually.

3. Take advantage of card protections and insurance

Part of the benefit of many travel cards is having built-in purchase protection and travel insurance coverage. This could come in handy if your phone or another item is lost or stolen while traveling, if your luggage is delayed or lost, if your trip is canceled or interrupted, or many other potential situations.

You typically have to pay for applicable trip expenses, such as flights, to take advantage of these benefits.

How do travel credit cards work?

Travel credit cards offer points and miles rewards on your spending, which you can use toward travel-related redemptions, such as flights, hotel stays, and car rentals. You’ll often earn the highest rewards rate on travel purchases with a travel credit card, though many also offer boosted rewards on everyday purchases like groceries, gas, and more.

Many travel cards also provide travel benefits and perks, which could include airport lounge access, annual travel or airline credits, companion airfare, or elite status with an airline or hotel loyalty program.

Types of travel credit cards

When you’re comparing travel credit cards, it can be useful to separate them into two distinct types: general travel rewards cards and co-branded airline and hotel credit cards.

General travel rewards cards

With a general travel credit card, you’ll have a number of flexible redemption options when you’re ready to redeem your points and miles. You may also have a broader range of benefits. Some general travel credit cards include:

Chase Sapphire Preferred Card

Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card

American Express Gold Card

Travel card issuers generally have their own travel portals, like Chase Travel or American Express Membership Rewards. You can use these to book flights, hotels, rental cars, and more. They may also have a number of travel partners, to which you can directly transfer points or miles. For example, American Express Membership Rewards points transfer to Delta SkyMiles at a rate of 1:1.

The flexibility of general travel cards means you can travel with any number of different airlines or hotel brands and get the best bang for your buck. Each time you’re ready to book, simply shop around between the portal or partners and compare the best options for your specific travel plans.

These credit cards also allow other redemption options, such as statement credits, gift cards, and cash back. But you’ll generally get the best value by redeeming points or miles for travel.

Airline and hotel credit cards

Airline and hotel credit cards are typically co-branded between the card issuer and the airline or hotel chain. Here are a few examples:

Alaska Airlines Visa Signature credit card

United Quest Card

Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card

These cards are best suited for travelers who prefer to fly with a specific airline or stay at a certain hotel chain. Maybe you live near a hub airport, frequent a destination where a specific airline offers the most direct flight options, or you enjoy the perks of a specific hotel’s loyalty program.

Instead of flexible rewards points or miles, you’ll earn points or miles within the airline or hotel rewards program, like Marriott Bonvoy points or American Airlines AAdvantage miles — and get a boosted rewards rate when you spend directly with the airline or hotel. These cards often offer a faster path to elite status tiers within these programs as well.

You’ll typically get the best redemption rate when you use rewards for flights with the airline or stays at a hotel, but many programs offer other redemptions, too. Some airline and hotel rewards programs may even allow you to transfer your points and miles to other travel partners like you can with general travel rewards programs.

The added benefits of co-branded cards are designed to appeal to loyal airline or hotel customers. For example, your airline card may get you priority boarding, upgrades, free checked bags, and in-flight discounts. And your hotel card may offer early check-in or late checkout, annual free night awards, and on-site credits.

Co-branded travel cards aren’t for everyone, but they can add a lot to your travel experience if you have a strong airline or hotel preference.

What to look for in a travel credit card

Here are a few key details to look for in any new travel credit card:

1. Annual fee

No matter your budget, there’s a travel credit card with an annual fee that fits. You can find solid no annual fee options, like the U.S. Bank Altitude Connect Visa Signature card. But there are also plenty of premium travel cards with steep fees — the American Express Platinum Card®, for example, may set you back $695 per year (see rates and fees) but comes with an abundance of valuable benefits and perks that can potentially give you even more value back each year.

The most important thing to keep in mind when deciding whether an annual fee is worth it for you is whether you can get enough out of the rewards and benefits to outweigh the cost — without spending more than you otherwise would or can afford.

2. Sign-up bonus

For new cardholders, a sign-up bonus can offer major first-year value. These bonuses may be worth anything from 10,000 to over 100,000 bonus points or miles — which can translate to hundreds of dollars in rewards value.

However, you should compare the terms of the bonus to your own budget before you apply. For example, you may need to spend $4,000 within the first three months of opening your card before you can earn the 60,000 bonus points. If that’s not within your typical spending, be careful not to take on debt to meet the spending threshold. Accruing high interest on balances can quickly outpace even the best bonus.

One smart strategy is opening a new travel credit card when you’re booking a trip you’ve been saving for. You may already be prepared to spend more than usual, which can help you reach the bonus requirement faster. Plus, you can earn rewards on those travel purchases to put toward future trips.

Also look out for limited-time offers from top travel credit cards. Occasionally, issuers will increase the welcome bonus for a period of time — if you see a promotional offer that fits within your budget, that could be a great time to apply for a new card.

3. Rewards

Rewards are one of the biggest reasons for many people to open a travel credit card.

Earning rewards with travel cards often works in one of two ways. You’ll either earn rewards on your everyday spending (groceries, gas stations, restaurants) to redeem toward future travel, or earn rewards on your travel spending to put toward future travel.

Some cards offer a combination of these rewards, but knowing which type of spender you are can be useful. If your monthly budget is largely dedicated to everyday spending, you may get more value from the former. But if you travel frequently and spend a lot of money on flights, hotels, and rental cars, you can quickly rack up more points with travel-based rewards categories.

4. Travel perks and benefits

Many travel rewards credit cards — especially the most premium cards with high annual fees — really shine when it comes to added perks and benefits. These benefits can help you offset the annual fee and save money each time you travel.

Take the $395 annual fee Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, for example. Each year, you’ll get a $300 annual credit for bookings through Capital One Travel and 10,000 bonus miles (equal to $100 towards travel) on your account anniversary. Already, that’s enough to wipe out the annual cost — before accounting for any rewards and other benefits (like up to $120 in fee credits toward TSA PreCheck or Global Entry and Priority Pass Select airport lounge membership).

Just remember: Choose a card with benefits that help you save on purchases you would still have made otherwise. If you tend to arrive shortly before takeoff and don’t care about airport lounge access, you won’t actually get the $200 potential value from that benefit.

5. Travel insurance and protections

One unique aspect of travel credit cards is the protections you can get as a cardholder when you travel. Common protections offered by travel credit cards include trip cancellation and interruption insurance, car rental insurance, trip delay reimbursement, baggage delay insurance, access to emergency assistance services, and more.

As long as you pay for your travel expenses with the card (booking flights, hotels, tours, etc.) you can qualify for these travel protection benefits. Like any coverage, though, you should make sure to read the fine print of what your individual card offers. These benefits can vary greatly between different travel cards, so make sure to look for details in your card agreement.

More travel credit card tips

Is a travel card worth it?

Travel credit cards are worth it if you get enough value from the card’s benefits and rewards to outweigh any potential costs, such as an annual fee. Unlike some other rewards cards, like cash-back credit cards, travel cards are more likely to carry annual fees in exchange for their high rewards rates and annual benefits. They might not be worth it if you don’t travel enough to take advantage of these card benefits and rewards.

However, a travel card can still be worth it if you’re not a frequent traveler. Even if you travel only once or twice per year, you can accumulate points throughout the year to offset your airfare and hotel costs when you do go on a trip.

Travel credit cards frequently asked questions (FAQs)

Should I open a travel credit card?

Travel rewards credit cards can make a great addition to your wallet, even if you only travel a few times per year. Be sure to compare different travel card options to find the combination of annual fee, rewards, benefits, and sign-up bonus that works best for your travel plans and spending.

There may be a few reasons why a travel credit card isn’t right for you, though:

You’re already in credit card debt. Avoid adding another card — especially one with a potentially high annual fee — to your wallet if you already have high-interest debt. Eliminating those balances will help you save a lot more in interest than any value travel rewards could offer.

You don’t want to keep up with a rewards strategy. Travel credit cards can be most lucrative if you maximize how you earn and redeem rewards. If you don’t want to spend the time strategizing bonus categories and the best redemption options, a credit card with a simpler rewards structure may be better for you.

You don’t have great credit. Travel credit cards generally require a good-to-excellent credit score to qualify for approval. If your credit isn’t in a great place right now, focus on improving your score before you apply for a new card.

If you are ready to open a travel credit card, time your application wisely. The spending thresholds to earn your welcome bonus can be high, so you may want to plan your application around your next trip. The money you’ve already saved can help you score the bonus when you book your travel, and you’ll also earn bonus points or miles for your next trip.

Which credit card is best for travel?

If you're new to travel credit cards, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is a great place to start — you can earn 2x miles on everything, and it's easy to redeem your miles through Capital One's travel portal.

Before you apply for any new travel card though, look at your frequent spending and travel to find the best one for your individual goals.

Which card is better for international travel?

When traveling abroad, look for credit cards that don't charge foreign transaction fees. All of the cards on the list above waive foreign transaction fees, so you won’t have to worry about extra charges when you use them to travel internationally.

One thing to keep in mind while traveling abroad is worldwide acceptance of your card. It can be useful to travel with more than one credit card on different card networks (these include Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover).

Which travel credit card is the most elite?

For a premium travel experience, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is our top pick. However, there are other premium travel cards with valuable benefits for travelers — including annual credits, elite status, bonus rewards, and more — for higher annual fees.

Our methodology

We began our search for the best travel cards with a list of 70 credit cards that offer travel rewards and benefits. This list includes general travel cards with flexible rewards programs, as well as co-branded hotel and airline cards that earn points and miles within a specific program. Our methodology focuses on cards that offer the greatest value to the broadest range of cardholders — without a significant annual cost.

We start with each card’s welcome offer, which we rate based on the value of the bonus, the spending required to qualify, and a ratio comparing the bonus points or miles earned to the card’s annual fee. The more you’re spending to own the card, the more value we believe you should get in return.

Another large portion of the overall ratings is rewards and ongoing benefits. We give preference to cards with rewards categories that span both travel and everyday spending (gas stations, supermarkets, dining, streaming services, etc.) to help ensure you can maximize points even when you’re not on-the-go. We also consider redemption options for each card, with the most flexible rewards programs earning higher scores. Finally, we compare travel benefits like annual statement credits, airline status and award nights, companion offers, and other ongoing perks that might make opening a travel card worth it over the long-term.

We also look at each card’s annual fee, ongoing APR, credit score access, and foreign transaction fees — as well as issuer-specific information like customer service contact information, mobile app user ratings, and fraud protections. These are details we evaluate for every type of credit card.

The final picks on our list are the travel credit cards with the highest overall ratings given each of the criteria above. We sort out general travel cards first — these are the options that make up the primary list, because they are more flexible for a larger number of travelers. But we also include top-scoring hotel and airline co-branded cards. These are great options for some travelers, though you should consider how often you travel with the hotel or airline before you consider one of these cards.

Learn more about certificates of deposit (CDs)

CDs are a type of deposit account that may or may not be the right fit depending on your unique savings goals. Before opting for a CD, it’s important to fully understand how they work, the benefits and drawbacks of a CD, and where CD rates stand today.

CD rates today

The highest-paying CDs are currently offering APYs up to 4.1%, though these are only available at select banks. Nationally, the average interest rate on a 6-month CD is 1.49%, according to the FDIC. Current CD rates are falling from their recent peak thanks to the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to begin lowering the federal funds rate.

What is a good CD rate?

The interest rate on a CD plays a key role in how your money grows over time. A higher rate means your balance will earn interest faster and give you a better return on your investment. Today, CD rates range quite a bit depending on the financial institution. However, the best rates hover around 4% APY.

One of the biggest benefits of a CD is that these rates are locked in; once you open and fund your account, you don’t have to worry about your rate changing. This is also why it’s crucial to make sure you’re locking in the best possible rate when opening an account. Learn more about good CD rates today.

How do CDs work?

CDs work differently from other types of deposit accounts. Unlike a traditional savings account, for example, a CD requires you to keep your money on deposit for a set period of time. However, CDs also typically offer higher interest rates than most other types of savings accounts in exchange for locking in your money.

CD terms can range from a few months to several years. As long as your money remains untouched, you can expect your balance to keep growing. However, making an early withdrawal from your CD will likely result in a penalty. Learn more about how CDs work and how to choose the right one.

How much do you need to open a CD?

The minimum amount needed to open a CD varies depending on the financial institution and the specific type of CD. Often, you’ll need at least $500 to $1,000 to open an account, although there are many banks and credit unions that offer CDs with no minimum balance requirement. Learn more about minimum balances for CDs.

Types of CDs

CDs are not all structured the same way, and you might find that one type of CD works better for your savings strategy than another.

These are the most common types of CDs available:

High-yield CD : A high-yield CD offers a higher rate than traditional CDs.

No-penalty CD : This type of CD gives you the option to withdraw funds from your account before the maturity date without paying a penalty.

Bump-up CD : These CDs allow you to take advantage of interest rate increases during the term. For example, say you opened your CD at 4.00% APY, but your financial institution raised that rate to 4.25% soon after. With a bump-up CD, you can request to increase your rate to the current one being advertised.

Jumbo CD : Jumbo CDs typically offer a higher interest rate but require a higher minimum deposit than most other CD products — usually starting at $100,000.

Callable CD : If interest rates fall, your bank may redeem a callable CD before its maturity date. In this case, you’d get your principal balance back, plus any earned interest up to that point.

Brokered CD : Brokered CDs are purchased from a brokerage firm, rather than a bank. They are often higher risk than traditional CDs.

Share certificate: A share certificate is essentially the same thing as a CD, except they’re offered by credit unions.

Are CDs FDIC-insured?

CDs are usually insured by the federal government. Any CD you open with an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union is covered up to $250,000 per depositor. If your financial institution fails, the government guarantees the balance of your account up to $250,000. Learn more about FDIC insurance for CDs.

Pros and cons of CDs

Consider these important pros and cons of CDs before opening an account:

Pros

CDs are a great intro to personal finance tools. Unlike the stock market, CDs offer safe, reliable returns with no rate changes.

CDs offer fixed interest rates with higher returns on average compared with other deposit accounts.

When you open a CD at a federally insured bank or credit union, that CD is insured up to $250,000.

Opening a CD may discourage you from tapping into your savings early.

Cons

You'll typically pay an early withdrawal penalty if you need your cash before the CD’s maturity date.

The competitive rates on CDs — especially longer-term CDs — might not keep up with inflation.

The minimum balance needed to open a CD may be too high.

Although CDs are safer, they offer lower returns than mutual funds and stocks.

Learn more about the pros and cons of CDs.

Are CDs worth it?

CDs can give you a solid return on your savings if you secure an account with a high APY, but they are not without their limitations. When determining if a CD is right for you, consider how often you need to access your money and whether there are other options that could help you meet your savings goals. Learn more about when CDs are worth it.

What is a CD early withdrawal penalty?

Most CDs impose an early withdrawal penalty if you access your funds before the account reaches maturity. The exact amount of the penalty depends on the financial institution’s policies and often the length of the CD term. This penalty is usually expressed as a certain number of days or months’ worth of interest. Learn more about early withdrawal penalties.

What to do with a CD when it matures

When your CD matures, you have a few options for how to proceed. You might decide to renew your CD for the same term length at the current interest rate. You can also withdraw the funds and open a new CD with a different bank, put your money into a different type of savings account, explore new investment options, or use the money to fund a major purchase.

When your CD reaches maturity, your bank will likely give you a short grace period before automatically renewing your CD, during which time you should take action and make a decision about how to best use those funds. Learn more about what to do when a CD matures.

How to set up a CD ladder

You may be worried about locking your money into a CD and missing out on higher interest rates in the future. And in an environment where interest rates are rising, missing out on a great rate is a real possibility.

CD laddering can help you avoid the risk of missing out on higher CD rates later. With a CD ladder, you split your savings among multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates (e.g., a 6-month CD, a 1-year CD, and a 2-year CD). When the first CD in your ladder matures, you can access those funds if you need them or roll the cash into a new CD — perhaps at a higher interest rate if one is available at that time. Meanwhile, your longer-term CDs will continue earning the rate you locked in when you opened them. Learn more about creating a CD ladder.

Short- or long-term CD: Which is best?

The term of your CD — the length of time it takes your CD to mature — can affect the interest rate a bank offers you. Typically, long-term CDs feature higher APYs as a benefit of letting the bank hold on to your cash for a longer period. But longer terms don’t always equal higher interest rates.

In the current market, average interest rates increase between 1-month and 1-year CDs. Yet that upward trend isn't consistent with all longer-term CDs. Data from the FDIC finds the average 2-year CD rate to be 1.42%, but a 4-year CD sits at 1.24%. As you can see, today's best CD rates aren’t necessarily tied to accounts with the longest terms. Learn more about choosing between a short- or long-term CD.

Can you lose money in a CD?

CDs are considered low-risk investments because they offer a fixed interest rate. Once that rate is locked in, it won’t fluctuate as a result of major economic events or stock market swings. Plus, you won’t lose your principal deposit. Still, CDs are not completely risk-free. Learn more about whether you can lose money in a CD.

Can you gift a certificate of deposit?

Gifting a certificate of deposit is possible, but there are certain rules about who you can give one to and how to go about it. Generally, the owner of a CD must open the account in their name, so you can't offer a certificate of deposit gift to another adult. However, you can open a custodial account for a child and offer a CD as a gift. Learn more about gifting CDs.

CDs vs. bonds

CDs and bonds are both considered low-risk places to put your money, but they function quite differently. Bonds may offer greater liquidity than CDs because you can sell them at any time, whereas CDs are locked in for the duration of the term. These two types of investments are also insured by different entities. Learn more about CDs vs. bonds.

CDs vs. Treasury bills

Another low-risk investment option, Treasury bills have become more popular in recent years. Also known as T-bills, these investments are backed by the U.S. government, offer competitive rates, and may be a more favorable option for short-term savers. Unlike CDs, T-bills provide greater liquidity and can be sold at any time. Learn more about CDs vs. Treasury bills.

CDs vs. money market accounts

Both money market accounts and CDs are known for offering higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts. They’re also both federally insured in most cases. However, CDs and money market accounts differ in a few key ways, including when it comes to fees, accessibility, and more. Learn more about CDs vs. money markets.

Best CD rates methodology

Our grading system, collected and carefully reviewed by our personal finance experts, comprised nearly 300 data points for approximately 60 federally insured CDs across 6-month, 1-year, and 18-month terms. We used this data to develop our list of the best CDs.

We evaluated these accounts according to several key metrics, including annual percentage yield, minimum opening deposit, compounding frequency, and more.

The accounts on our list could earn a maximum of 25 points across all metrics. Here’s a closer look at the categories we considered:

Annual percentage yield (APY): Accounts with higher APYs were rewarded with more points than those with lower APYs. Note that rates on our list are current at the time of publishing but are subject to change at any time.

Minimum opening deposit: Many CDs require a minimum deposit to open an account. Accounts with no or low minimum deposit requirements ranked more favorably than those with higher opening deposit requirements.

Compounding frequency: Compounding can occur daily, monthly, quarterly, or even annually. We awarded more points to accounts that compound interest frequently.

Customer service contact methods: Our team awarded one point for every contact method available to customers (phone, email, chat).

Why should I open a savings account?

Opening a savings account is a smart financial move. For one, these accounts provide a safe place to store your money while earning interest, helping your savings grow over time. Plus, unlike keeping cash on hand or in a checking account, a savings account encourages financial discipline by separating money meant for future goals from everyday spending. And as long as you open an account with a reputable, federally insured bank or credit union, your deposits are protected in case the financial institution fails — up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, per ownership category.

Learn more: 6 benefits of opening a savings account you shouldn't overlook

What is a high-yield savings account?

A high-yield savings account functions similarly to a traditional savings account. The main difference is that HYSAs offer much higher interest rates. In fact, some of the best HYSAs offer annual percentage yields (APYs) 10 times higher than the national average savings account rate.

Keep in mind that some banks may require you to maintain a minimum balance to earn interest or avoid a monthly service charge. However, there are plenty of accounts that offer the same rate regardless of your balance and do not charge monthly fees. When shopping around for an HYSA, it's important to compare multiple offers and select an account that fits your needs.

Learn more: High-yield savings account vs. traditional savings account: Which one is better?

What is APY?

A high-yield savings account’s interest rate represents how much you’ll earn in simple interest. On the other hand, the annual percentage yield (APY) is the rate of return including compound interest, which is the interest you earn on both the principal balance and interest you've accrued previously. Most savings accounts compound interest daily or monthly. The more often interest compounds, the faster your money will grow.

HYSAs come with variable interest rates. That means your bank or credit union can change your APY at any time. Generally, APYs increase when the economy is doing well, and the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark rate. Conversely, rates can drop when the economy weakens, and the Fed lowers rates.

Learn more: What is compound interest, and how is it calculated?

What is a good savings account rate?

Because savings account rates fluctuate, what is considered a ""good"" rate can change over time. Generally, a savings account that earns more than the national average is considered good. Today, the national average rate is just 0.4%, while the top high-yield savings accounts offer around 3% to 4% APY.

Learn more: What is a good savings account interest rate?

Do you pay taxes on high-yield savings accounts?

Yes, the interest earned in an HYSA is taxable income. You should receive a Form 1099-INT from your bank if you earn more than $10 in interest during the year, which you need to report on your tax return. However, even if you don't receive this form, you are responsible for reporting all interest income to the IRS.

Learn more: How to avoid taxes on savings account interest

Pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts

There are many benefits of opening a high-yield savings account, particularly the opportunity to earn a competitive rate on your balance. However, there are some drawbacks to consider as well. Let’s take a closer look at the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts:

Pros:

Higher interest rates: You’ll generally earn more interest than you would with a traditional savings account.

Compound interest: Compounding interest helps your balance grow more quickly. Interest in an HYSA may compound daily or monthly.

Accessibility: These accounts are a great place to stash money you may need to access quickly, such as your emergency fund. Other types of accounts, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), offer high rates but impose penalties if you withdraw money prior to the maturity date.

Minimal or no fees: Fees with high-yield savings accounts are rare, so you won’t need to worry about these costs eating into your balance.

Low-risk: High-yield savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Plus, unlike investments, account performance isn’t tied to the stock market and you can’t lose money, making HYSAs a low-risk option for your money.

Cons:

Variable rates: Your savings account’s APY can increase or decrease over time. While individual banks set rates at their discretion, these rates are loosely tied to the federal funds rate. Banks may choose to increase or decrease savings rates when the Fed adjusts its target rate.

Minimum balance requirement: Some accounts may have a high minimum opening deposit.

Tiered APYs: Some banks may have tiered APYs depending on the deposit amount. For instance, you may earn a higher rate if you deposit $5,000 vs. $100. So, while a $5,000 deposit isn’t necessarily required, it could result in a better APY.

Better for short-term savings: High-yield savings accounts aren’t the best choice for long-term savings goals, like retirement. Investment accounts tend to offer higher long-term returns.

Withdrawal limits may apply: Depending on your bank, you may have a limit on monthly withdrawals.

Alternatives to high-yield savings accounts

An HYSA can be a smart place to store your savings, but it's not your only option. Here's a look at some of the alternatives you may want to consider.

Money market accounts

Money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts both offer higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts. However, these accounts come with different features. For instance, MMAs typically offer check-writing abilities and debit cards, though they might require higher minimum balances to earn the top interest rates. High-yield savings accounts, on the other hand, are designed to store your savings longer-term with fewer withdrawal options.

Learn more about money market accounts vs. high-yield savings accounts.

CDs

Like high-yield savings accounts, CDs can provide a safe place to store your savings while earning a competitive return. The big difference is that CDs require you to lock in your money for a set period, known as the term, which can range from a few months to several years. For this reason, CDs are a better option for people who don't need immediate access to their funds.

Learn more about high-yield savings accounts vs. CDs.

Investing

High-yield savings accounts and investing serve vastly different financial goals and risk profiles. HYSAs provide stable, low-risk returns with interest rates higher than traditional savings accounts. They're best for short-term financial goals or emergency funds due to their liquidity and FDIC insurance. Investing in bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and other securities typically involves higher risk — but also the potential for higher returns over the long run. Investing your money makes more sense for long-term financial goals like retirement since the returns generally outpace inflation and help grow wealth over time.

Overview of today's high-yield savings account rates

Today, savings accounts offer competitive rates by historical standards. Even though the national average rate for traditional savings accounts is just 0.4%, the best high-yield savings accounts still pay upwards of 4% APY.

Over the past decade, savings account interest rates have experienced significant fluctuations. In the mid-2010s, rates were considerably low — below 1% — thanks to the Federal Reserve's efforts to stimulate economic growth following the 2008 financial crisis. As the economy recovered, the Fed incrementally increased the federal funds rate between 2015 and 2018, leading to a gradual rise in savings account rates. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 prompted a return to near-zero interest rates to support economic activity, resulting in a decline in savings yields.

However, this led to a period of rising inflation, so the Fed implemented several rate hikes, contributing to the current higher yields on savings accounts. Even so, rates are now back on a downward trend as the Fed began cutting its target rate again in late 2024.

Tips for finding the best high-yield savings account

Competitive rates are great, but considering other factors besides APY can help you find an account that best meets your needs.

New account offers: Look at high-yield savings account offers for new depositors with high APYs, low to no account fees, and are free to open. High savings account rates will earn you more interest, but the financial institution offering those rates might not necessarily be the best option for your finances, so do your research before opening an account.

Required deposits: Research applicable deposit requirements. Is there a minimum initial deposit requirement? Do any other deposit requirements apply? Are there tiered APYs depending on your deposit amount?

Fees: Some accounts may have monthly maintenance fees or other fees. Look into which fees may apply before opening a new account.

Accessibility: Understand how you can access your money before opening a new account. For example, can you log into an online dashboard? Does your bank have a mobile app? Is it connected to an ATM network?

Deposit options: Review available deposit options. Are mobile check deposits via a mobile banking app an option? Can you make direct deposits via an ATM?

Account linking: Look into whether you can link your new account to an existing checking account at another bank. Make sure there are no restrictions or waiting periods when it comes to accessing your money.

Learn more: How to choose the right high-yield savings account for you.

How to open a high-yield savings account

Once you’ve determined the best high-yield savings account for you, opening one is simple and can be done in person or online. You’ll generally need to provide your personal information, proof of identity, and address to open a new account. Make sure you have your driver’s license, Social Security number, and copies of a recent mortgage statement or utility bill.

Depending on the account, a minimum deposit amount could apply when you open your HYSA account. If that’s the case, you’ll also need to be ready to transfer money from an existing account to meet the deposit requirement.

Money market accounts can be a good place to hold your savings, but they function differently from a traditional savings account. Here’s what you need to know about money market accounts before opening one.

What is a money market account?

Money market accounts help you achieve your short-term savings goals faster due to a higher annual percentage yield (APY) than regular savings or checking accounts. Plus, this type of account provides easy access to your funds, along with some of the best features of a checking account, such as debit cards and check-writing capabilities.

Learn more: What is a money market account, and how does it work?

Is a money market account a savings account?

A money market account is a type of deposit account that typically pays a higher yield than most traditional savings accounts and may come with a debit card and check-writing privileges. Although, like a savings account, there may be limitations on how much you can withdraw and how often. You can certainly use a money market account to grow your savings, but it isn’t the same thing as a savings account.

Learn more: Is a money market account a savings account?

How often do money market accounts pay interest?

Like other interest-bearing deposit accounts, MMAs compound the interest you earn. Interest typically compounds daily and gets credited to your balance monthly (though this is not always the case). Compounding interest increases your APY because interest accrues not only on your principal balance, but on the interest you've accrued so far.

Learn more: How often do money market accounts pay interest?

Current money market rates

The current average savings account rate is just 0.4%, and the average money market rate is 0.58%, according to the FDIC. However, there are money market accounts that pay much more — as high as 4% APY or more.

Learn more: What is the national average money market account rate?

Example benefits of high money market rates

Because money market bank account rates vary widely, it's important to choose an account with a competitive rate. This allows your money to grow faster.

Here's how much you could earn if you deposited $10,000 into an account with one of the highest money market rates instead of a traditional savings account (assumes interest is compounded daily and credited monthly):

How much is a money market account minimum balance?

Minimum balance requirements can vary. In some cases, you may need to meet a certain minimum balance or initial deposit requirement to avoid a monthly fee or earn interest.

Learn more: How much is a money market account minimum balance?

Are money market accounts insured by the FDIC?

Like other deposit accounts, the funds in your money market account are typically federally insured, either through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Both the FDIC and NCUA offer $250,000 in coverage per institution, per depositor, per ownership category. That should cover most people, but individuals with high net worths may need to spread out their funds across multiple institutions to maximize their protection.

Learn more: Are money market accounts FDIC-insured?

Can you lose money in a money market account?

Money market accounts are generally safe, and you usually can’t lose your principal deposit. However, there are some instances when you could lose money. For instance, fees and rising inflation can potentially eat into your account balance.

Learn more: Can you lose money in a money market account?

Money market account vs. high-yield savings account

Money market accounts and HYSAs are two types of accounts you can use to grow your savings. They’re secure accounts backed by the FDIC or NCUA, and they both provide higher APYs than traditional savings accounts. However, these accounts do differ in several significant ways.

Learn more: MMAs vs. high-yield savings accounts

Money market account vs. CD

Money market accounts and CDs are both deposit accounts that tend to offer higher APYs than traditional savings accounts. However, money market accounts offer greater access to your funds than a CD. CDs offer a high APY in exchange for locking up your funds for a set period of time.

Learn more: MMAs vs. CDs

Money market account vs. money market fund

Money market funds and money market accounts may sound like the same thing, but they differ in a few key ways. Money market funds are not deposit accounts; they're a type of investment fund that pools money from multiple investors to invest in a basket of securities, such as stocks or bonds. A money market account, on the other hand, is a type of deposit account offered by many major banks and credit unions that typically pays a higher interest rate than traditional savings or checking accounts. MMAs may also come with a debit card, ATM card, and check-writing privileges.

Learn more: MMAs vs. money market funds

How to open a money market account

Opening a money market account is a fairly straightforward process. Once you’ve explored the account options offered by various financial institutions, you’ll need to gather some documentation. This may include your Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Tax Identification Number (TIN), government-issued ID, and proof of address. Once you have these documents in hand, you can begin your account application. This can be done in person, or in many cases, over the phone or online.

How do I choose the best free checking account?

There are several factors to consider when choosing a checking account to hold your everyday funds.

Account fees: Many banks and credit unions charge monthly fees for account maintenance. Often, these fees can be waived if you meet certain daily balance requirements. However, if you don’t meet these requirements, fees can eat into your account balance each month. This is why it’s important to read your account terms and conditions carefully to avoid surprise fees and ensure you meet the requirements to get fees waived.

ATM access and reimbursements: If you frequently pay for goods and services in cash, easy ATM access is a key feature to look for in a checking account. A fee-free network ensures you avoid extra fees each time you make a withdrawal — bonus points if your bank allows you to avoid ATM fees by reimbursing charges from out-of-network ATMs.

Access to physical branches/customer service representatives: Being able to speak with a customer service representative can make all the difference if you prefer to resolve banking issues or have your questions answered by a human in a timely manner. Otherwise, you may need to rely on a chatbot or automated calling. This isn’t always a drawback if you typically don’t require much help with your checking account. But if it’s a must-have, check each bank or credit union’s customer service options, hours, and branch locations near you.

Minimum balance to earn interest: If the checking account you’re considering is an interest-bearing account, check your account disclosure to determine if there is a minimum balance needed to earn the advertised rate. You may decide that an account with a high minimum balance requirement isn’t a good fit.

How to open a free checking account

Opening a checking account is fairly simple and can often be done online. The exact process may vary depending on the financial institution, but in general, you can expect to follow these steps:

Choose a bank or credit union: Most traditional banks, credit unions, and online banks offer checking accounts. However, the account fees, interest rates, and other perks will vary. Before selecting an account, read the terms and conditions of the accounts you’re considering to determine whether they meet your needs. Gather necessary documents: When you open a bank account, you’ll be required to submit documentation. This may include your Social Security number, driver’s license, or other government-issued identification, and a copy of a recent bill to verify your identity and address. Fill out an application: The application for a checking account will ask you for personal information such as your name, address, date of birth, annual income, and more. This is also the point at which you may be asked to provide copies of documents that show your personally identifiable information. Fund your checking account: Once your account is opened, the final step is to fund it. While many financial institutions do not require a minimum deposit to open, some of them do have rules in place that require you to fund your account within a certain amount of time to avoid an account closure.

5. Capital One: 4.5 stars

Best online bank for maintaining your credit score

Capital One has roots that stretch back more than 25 years as a credit card company, and it has since expanded to offer customers a full suite of banking products and services. In addition to a long list of financial products and services, Capital One offers an educational hub to teach customers how to manage their finances and plan for financial milestones.

Capital One has a large library of educational resources and credit tools.

Capital One also ranked highly in our customer experience category for having a high mobile app rating and a clear, easy-to-use website.

Although Capital One is a major player in online banking, it fell behind some of our top contenders for a few reasons. At 70,000+ ATMs, Capital One’s ATM network is not as large as our top picks, and it doesn’t offer reimbursement for out-of-network ATM fees.

Capital One also scored lower in our fee transparency category. While it does have individual account disclosures for each account type, the disclosures and fee schedules required a bit more digging to find than our top picks.

Capital One’s products:

Credit cards: Capital One offers credit-building cards, cash-back cards, and rewards cards that allow customers to earn points for purchases on dining, travel, and entertainment. It also offers student cards, business cards, and low-intro APR credit cards.

Checking accounts: In addition to its interest-earning 360 Checking account, Capital One allows younger customers to start managing their finances and earn interest through its teen checking account.

Savings accounts: Capital One has two savings accounts — a high-yield savings account and a fee-free kids savings account.

Certificates of deposit: Capital One’s CDs range from six months to five years with no minimum balance to open an account.

Auto loans: Capital One offers car loans for new and used cars.

Online banking vs. traditional banking: Key differences

Online banks and traditional brick-and-mortar banks typically offer the same types of products, but the lack of physical locations for online banks makes the banking experience quite different.

Branches: The most obvious difference between these two banking models is that brick-and-mortar banks have physical branches and online banks do not. If you’re the kind of customer who prefers to speak with a banking associate in person to open an account or resolve issues related to your account, an online bank may not be the right option for you. Fees and interest: Online banks usually have lower operating costs because they don’t have to maintain office buildings or other physical infrastructure. As a result, an online bank may offer more competitive APYs or lower fees on their products. This isn’t a guarantee, but it’s worth comparing both types of banks to secure the highest interest rates and lowest fees for the products you’re interested in. ATM access may be limited: Online banks typically do not have their own ATM network and rely on third-party networks to offer their customers ATM access. If you don’t like to carry cash and frequently use electronic transfers or payments, this is probably a non-issue. However, if you do use cash for certain expenses, it may be more difficult to access it without paying an extra fee. Certain third-party networks have the power to charge their own fees, even if your bank doesn’t. Many online banks offer ATM fee reimbursement, but it’s usually capped at a certain amount per month. Mobile app and online banking experience: Online banks exist solely online, so it’s only natural that most of them will invest heavily in those platforms and provide you with greater digital banking capabilities. This could include mobile check deposits, mobile wallet integration, card locking and unlocking, ATM locator tools, budgeting tools, and more. Many traditional banks offer mobile apps, but they may be more limited in what they offer.

What to consider when choosing an online bank

If you’re considering opening an online bank account, there are a few key factors you should consider to ensure that you choose the best bank for your personal finances.

Is this bank FDIC-insured?

Before considering any bank, whether it’s online or traditional, you should first verify that the bank is FDIC-insured. FDIC insurance protects the money in your deposit account up to $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category. Common ownership categories include single accounts, joint accounts, retirement accounts, trust accounts, business accounts, and more. The easiest way to verify that your bank offers deposit insurance is to use the FDIC’s ""BankFind"" tool which allows you to type in any bank’s name, URL, or FDIC certification number to verify that it is indeed covered by the FDIC. Many banks also denote their status with “Member FDIC” noted on their homepage.

How easy will it be to access your funds?

The benefit of a bricks-and-mortar institution is that you can usually stop by your local branch to deposit cash and withdraw money free of charge when you need it. Online banks can be a bit tricker. Many online banks offer fee-free ATM networks, but it’s not guaranteed that you’ll have an ATM close to home. ATM cards are also not a guarantee with every online bank, and in some cases your only option for accessing your funds could be via electronic transfer to another bank account.

If you plan to make frequent cash deposits or prefer to pay for certain expenses in cash, you’ll want to consider whether an online bank’s ATM network and ATM card privileges will work for you.

How easy is it to speak to a real person?

Customer service may not be at the top of your list of considerations when choosing a bank, but mishaps can happen, and when they do, you might want to have a real human helping you to resolve it rather than a chatbot.

Be sure to review each bank’s customer service options to learn more about its customer service hours and the different methods for reaching a representative.

What kinds of fees or account minimums does this bank charge?

Online banks don’t typically have the same operational costs as brick-and-mortar banks, which is good news for their customers. The bank might offer fee-free or low-fee accounts in certain instances, or higher APYs. However, this isn’t always the case. Be sure to read the account terms and conditions of any accounts you’re considering and compare those figures with rates and fees from other banks to find the best option for your needs.

What kinds of capabilities does this bank offer on its online and mobile banking platforms?

Research the features available to customers on this bank’s mobile app and online platform. Some banks may not invest heavily in their digital tools and websites, and as a result, you could be limited as a customer. Functions you may find useful include transferring money between accounts, mobile check deposits, setting up automatic bill payments, and more. Think carefully about the features and capabilities that matter most to you and factor those in when making your decision about the best online bank for you.

Best online bank frequently asked questions (FAQs)

What is online banking?

Online banking involves banking at financial institutions that don't operate physical branches. These banks typically offer similar products and financial services to credit unions and traditional banks, but customers do all of their banking online or via mobile app.

Are online banks safe?

Online banks are just as safe as traditional banks, if not more so. As long as your bank is protected by federal deposit insurance, your deposits are federally insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category.

What is one con to using an online-only bank?

The most obvious drawback of online banking is that you don’t have access to a physical branch or face-to-face customer service when you need it. However, many online banks have expanded their customer support offerings to include late-night, weekend, or even 24/7 service hours to give customers greater access to a service representative.

What is the best free online bank?

The best free online bank will depend on your needs and preferences. That said, we chose Ally Bank's spending account as our top free checking account for its no monthly maintenance fees, competitive interest rates, and great customer service. Learn more about how to find the best online checking account.

How do I open a bank account online?

To open a bank account online, you typically need to visit the bank's website, choose the type of account you want (e.g., checking, savings), and provide personal information such as your Social Security number, a valid ID, and address verification. The process is usually straightforward; simply fill out an online application, which can often be done in a matter of minutes.

Do online banks have ATMs?

Many online banks provide access to ATMs. They often partner with nationwide ATM networks such as Allpoint or MoneyPass, which allow customers to use ATMs across the country without incurring fees. Some online banks may also offer reimbursements for fees charged by out-of-network ATMs.

Which online bank offers the highest interest rates on savings accounts?

You can see a list of banks that offer savings accounts with 5% APY or higher here. Keep in mind these rates are subject to change, so always verify rates and account terms directly with the bank before opening an account.

What are the benefits of using an online bank?

The benefits of using an online bank include higher interest rates on deposit accounts, lower fees, and 24/7 access to banking services via desktop and mobile.

How do I withdraw and deposit cash in an online account?

To withdraw cash from an online account, you can often use network ATMs or electronically transfer money between accounts. Many online banks also allow you to deposit checks through mobile apps, while some accept cash deposits at network ATMs or via reload networks like Green Dot.

Best online banks methodology

Our grading system, collected and carefully reviewed by our personal finance experts, comprises over 600 data points for over 20 FDIC-insured online banks to develop our list of the top 10 best online banks. We compared these banks across key metrics, including fees, customer experience, product selection, account features and security, and environmental and social responsibility.

The banks on our list could earn a maximum of 75 points across all five categories. Here’s a closer look at the categories we considered:

Fees: 20 points

We weighed each bank’s fees for its most basic checking and savings account options, as well as overdraft fees and ATM fees. Banks were awarded points for having no or lower fees, greater fee transparency, and clear, easy-to-access fee structures.

Customer service experience: 28 points

Customer service is a key element in a bank’s product offering, especially with online banks, where visiting a branch and asking for in-person help is usually impossible. Banks were scored on metrics including mobile app ratings on Apple and Google storefronts and methods for reaching customer service representatives. Banks that offered phone, chat, and email contacts were awarded the maximum points in that category.

We examined each website for information clarity as part of the customer service offering assessment. This subjective assessment looked at each bank’s website design, ease of navigation, language clarity, and whether customers could easily gather all the needed information to make an informed decision about any particular product.

We also awarded points to banks that offered more extensive ATM networks, credit monitoring tools, and educational resources.

Product selection and account features: 14 points

Each bank we analyzed could earn one point per product for each of the following:

Checking accounts

Savings accounts

High-yield savings accounts

Money market accounts

Certificates of deposit

Mortgages

Personal loans

Auto loans

Home equity lines of credit

We also looked at the speed of ACH transfers and gave banks points for same- or next-day transfers, early access to paychecks, Zelle as a service, and being part of FedNow — the Federal Reserve’s instant payment service.

Security: 10 points

We carefully considered each bank's security measures to protect your money and sensitive information. We looked at factors such as multi-factor authentication, website encryption, alerts for suspicious activity, zero fraud liability, and whether each bank had a dedicated security page or hub.

Environmental and social responsibility: 3 points

Many consumers consider a bank’s carbon footprint and philanthropic efforts before deciding on a particular institution. As such, banks that have dedicated pages to their philanthropic efforts and environmental goals, and have pledged to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 scored up to 3 points for doing so.","['Ivana Pino', 'January', 'Min Read']"

When to shop for a mortgage lender

Your effort to find the best mortgage lender begins early in the home-buying process — before you start seriously shopping for a house.

You'll reach out to a lender to get an idea of where you stand. Perhaps confirm your homebuying qualifications with a second lender. Get a preapproval from one or the other. Then start house hunting.

After you have a contract on a home in hand, you'll expand your mortgage lender search, ask for loan offers, and narrow the field to a home loan lender that hits all the right notes.

How to shop for a mortgage lender

Your personal nominees for ""best mortgage lender"" to finance your house should come from different types of lenders: a bank, an online provider, or a local credit union, to name a few. Each will have their own strengths and weaknesses.

You will also want to consider lenders that specialize in the type of loan you may be looking for (if you know) — that might include conventional loans, VA-backed mortgages, lenders that cater to first-time home buyers, FHA loans, refi, jumbo, or home equity products.

When shopping multiple lenders, protect your credit score by submitting all loan preapproval applications within 45 days. FICO considers numerous credit inquiries for a single type of loan within a 45-day period to be related and won't compound the impact to your credit score.

What is a mortgage?

A mortgage is a type of loan used to buy a home. If you can’t afford to pay for a house in cash, you use the money you do have on hand for a down payment, then borrow the rest with a mortgage.

A mortgage is a secured loan, meaning your house is used as collateral. If you fail to make mortgage payments, you could face foreclosure and lose the house.

Types of mortgages offered by the best mortgage lenders

There are many types of mortgage loans, but the best mortgage lenders usually offer the following common kinds of home loans that benefit the most borrowers:

Conventional loans

You might think of a conventional loan as a “regular mortgage.” There are two types of conventional loans: conforming and jumbo.

People often use the terms “conventional” and “conforming” interchangeably — a conforming loan is simply a mortgage under the limit set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). In 2025, the conforming loan limit is $806,500 in most parts of the United States and $1,209,750 in higher-cost areas.

In 2026, the conforming loan limit increases to $832,750 in most parts of America and to $1,249,125 in specific high-cost areas.

A jumbo loan is a type of conventional loan for more than the FHFA limit, and you’ll usually need a higher credit score and down payment to qualify.

FHA loans

FHA loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Though the FHA backs these mortgages, you’ll still apply for them with a private mortgage lender.

These are good options for first-time home buyers because they only require a 580 credit score (with a 3.5% down payment) or a 500 score (with a 10% down payment). You can also qualify with a higher debt-to-income ratio than with conventional loans.

VA loans

A VA loan is insured by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and it’s for people affiliated with the military and their spouses. VA loans don’t have a set minimum credit score — the required score varies by lender. These loans also don’t require a down payment.

USDA loans

A USDA mortgage is for low-income borrowers buying in qualifying rural areas, and it’s insured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Other types of mortgages

The list of mortgage types goes on and on, but here are a few other kinds of mortgage loans you might qualify for:

Fixed-rate mortgage : This is a very common type of mortgage (you can get conventional, FHA, VA, and USDA loans with fixed rates) that keeps your rate the same for the entire life of the loan. On a 30-year loan, your monthly payment toward the mortgage principal and interest will be the same for the entire 30 years.

Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) : An ARM locks in your rate for a predetermined amount of time and then changes it regularly. For example, a 5/1 ARM keeps your rate the same for the first five years, then it increases or decreases once a year for the rest of your term.

HELOCs and home equity loans: Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans are “second mortgages.” You borrow against the equity in your home and have a second mortgage payment along with your first one.

How to get a mortgage

To get a mortgage loan, first, narrow your search down to three or four lenders. Apply for mortgage preapproval with all of them in a short time frame so that when you’re looking at interest rates and fees, you’re comparing apples to apples. Once you have a preapproval letter in hand, you can start shopping for homes.

When you make an offer on a home — and it is accepted — you’ll choose your favorite lender from your list and send them the necessary documentation, such as bank statements and tax returns, to apply for an official mortgage approval. The lender will usually take around 30 to 45 days to complete the underwriting process and schedule a closing day.

The day you close on the house, you will sign the paperwork for your mortgage, become a homeowner, and receive the keys to your new house.

Top 5 characteristics of the best mortgage lenders

When adding lenders to your roster of contenders, look for these five traits shared by the best mortgage lenders:

1. A smooth application process

A preapproval is the ticket to shopping for a house. But it's only the first step. The lenders competing to win your business should have low-friction application procedures and easy document exchange, preferably with secure online paperwork capabilities.

2. A wide selection of loan options

Starting out, you may not know your best loan option. Is it a conventional mortgage or an FHA-backed loan? Maybe a jumbo? The lenders you talk to should be well-equipped to meet your funding needs with a variety of mortgage loan types.

3. Low or no origination fee

The best mortgage companies fairly price their loans without piling on a lot of expensive fees. There is a long list of potential loan charges to be aware of, but a mortgage origination fee can be as much as 0.5% to 1% or more of the loan cost. Look for lenders who waive lender origination fees.

4. Responsive and proactive customer support

Are your questions answered quickly, and are you guided through the loan process along the way? The best mortgage lenders provide concierge-level service.

5. Rate transparency

The best lenders will show interest rates on a number of loan options and clearly disclose fees built into the interest rate, such as discount points.

Best mortgage lenders FAQs

Is it better to get a mortgage from a bank or a private lender?

Mortgage lenders are often better than banks because they specialize in home loans rather than a variety of financial products. They also usually have a quicker mortgage underwriting process. But your bank could be a good fit if it offers special mortgage perks such as interest rate discounts for existing customers. Some national banks, such as Truist, also have the bandwidth to offer unique benefits to mortgage borrowers.

What is the best bank to get a mortgage from?

If you’re set on using a bank rather than a mortgage lender, the best bank may be the one you already use. Banks sometimes offer benefits to home buyers who are already customers. Otherwise, Yahoo Finance’s top bank for mortgages is Bank of America because it ranks high in our affordability, interest rate, and rate transparency categories. Truist is also a strong bank contender for home loans.

Who is the No. 1 mortgage lender in the U.S.?

Rocket Mortgage is the top mortgage lender in America by loan volume. It also ranks above average in customer satisfaction according to the 2024 J.D. Power Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study.

What is the best place to get a mortgage loan?

The best place to get a mortgage loan depends on what type of mortgage you need. For example, at Yahoo Finance, we consider Navy Federal to be the best lender for a VA loan, PNC to be the best place to get an FHA loan, and Rocket Mortgage to be the best for first-time home buyers. It's a matter of finding a lender that best suits your circumstances.

What lender has the lowest mortgage rates?

Yahoo Finance has assessed over 40 top mortgage lenders’ interest rates using Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data. Of the companies we’ve evaluated, the lenders that had the best mortgage rates in 2024 were Bank of America, Pennymac, Navy Federal Credit Union, Citibank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union, Planet Home Lending, Carrington Mortgage Services, Freedom Mortgage Corporation, and Amerisave.

Does it matter which mortgage lender you go with?

Yes, it's crucial to shop around to find the right mortgage lender. Some may offer a unique type of mortgage loan that's best for your situation, such as an ITIN mortgage or investment property loan. Lenders have different interest rates based on your finances and the type of loan, and they charge different fees. It's helpful to apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four so you can compare these offerings.

Our methodology: How we chose the best mortgage lenders

Yahoo Finance reviews mortgage lenders based on five primary considerations: 1) Interest rates. Using 2024 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data from almost 5,000 mortgage companies, we analyze mortgage lenders based on issued mortgage rates below or above the annual median of reporting lenders. 2) Affordability. A measure of loan product availability and the willingness of a lender to offer government-backed loans, low down payments, down payment assistance, and consideration of nontraditional credit. 3) Loan costs. HMDA data is again analyzed, and total loan costs are compared to the annual median. 4) Rate transparency. The ability of a website user to obtain a mortgage interest rate estimate. We also consider whether rates are enhanced with discount points or high credit score requirements, disclaimers revealing rate assumptions, sample advertised rates, and whether adjustable or no discount point rate estimates are available. 5) Online features. An analysis of the educational material, calculators, and additional resources available to users.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,How to get the lowest mortgage rate possible,"The average 30-year mortgage rate has finally ticked down after three consecutive weeks of increases, according to Freddie Mac. Annual rates have also fallen, which means you still have the opportunity to lock in a better rate than you would have a year ago. So, how can you get the lowest mortgage rate possible in today’s housing market?

Which lenders offer the lowest mortgage rates?

Analysis by Yahoo Finance of nearly 5,000 mortgage lenders reporting 2024 loan information under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act reveals the surprising truth: the lenders offering the lowest mortgage rates.

Unfortunately, the results won't help the typical borrower.

By and large, the mortgage lenders who offered astonishing, rock-bottom mortgage rates made a tiny number of loans — no doubt allowing drastic rate concessions to a small slice of preferred customers. We're talking median interest rates from 2.4% to 4.75%, which are made by lenders underwriting loans to as few as a handful of customers.

Other lenders offering the absolute lowest mortgage rates in 2024 were banks catering to select clientele, credit unions serving local members, and homebuilders financing their own construction.

So, what if you aren't buying new construction from a lender offering a buydown, a member of a credit union willing to offer below-market-rate loans, or an affluent investor with a million-dollar portfolio?

Here are eight strategies to get the lowest mortgage rates with the cheapest home loan you can qualify for — all while using a regular, more well-known mortgage lender.

How can I get the lowest mortgage interest rate?

1. Improve your credit score

You may already know that mortgage rates vary by credit score. Whenever you boost your credit score from a lower to a higher tier, you save money.

For example, the entry-level FICO Score of 620 might earn you an annual percentage rate, or APR, of 7.30% (based on mortgage rates as of early December, with the purchase of one discount point). Raise your score to the next credit band of 640 to 659, and your interest rate could improve to 7.11%.

Bigger rate discounts are offered as you climb the credit score ladder. Here are the interest rate breaks as shown by MyFico.com's Loan Savings Calculator:

2. Lower your debt-to-income ratio

The amount of recurring monthly debt you carry when applying for a mortgage is another significant factor in the interest rate you'll earn. The more debt, the higher your mortgage rate.

To get the lowest mortgage rate, aim for a DTI of 25% or less. To calculate your debt-to-income ratio, divide your total monthly debt by your monthly income before withholdings. For example, say you need $700 for monthly rent, $300 for a vehicle loan, and $100 in student loan payments. That's $1,100. With a monthly gross income of $5,000, your DTI is 22%.

1100 / 5000 = 0.22

You're in the pocket for a lower mortgage rate. Mortgage lenders may consider DTIs up to 50%, but prefer 35% or less — and the lowest mortgage rates go to borrowers with DTIs of 25% or less.

3. Make a larger down payment

Another best practice for getting the lowest mortgage rate is to make as much of a down payment as you comfortably can. While you can get a home loan with as little as 3% down, paying more upfront will earn you a lower mortgage rate.

For first-time home buyers, the median down payment was 9% in 2024, according to the National Association of Realtors.

4. Buy discount points

Prepaying interest to lower your ongoing mortgage rate, called buying discount points, gains popularity in times of higher interest rates.

Buying one point equals 1% of the loan amount and will generally reduce your interest rate by one-quarter of a percentage point. Any number of points can be purchased and applied in fractional amounts too.

However, it's a good idea to calculate the up-front cost of buying points and compare that with the discount you receive on your long-term interest rate. Other factors to consider in this calculation include how long you expect to live in the home and your down payment.

Zero-points mortgage rates

Lenders sometimes add a point or two to a mortgage proposal to make their offered interest rate appear more enticing. But remember, you're actually paying for the discount with an up-front fee.

When shopping for a loan, compare loan offers with zero points. Then, you can decide how many points to buy, if any, to lower your interest rate.

Mortgage rate under 5%

Here's a surprising fact: In a Zillow survey of home buyers over seven months of 2024, about 45% obtained a mortgage rate below 5% — when rates were above 6.5%, like they are now.

How? One-third were successful in negotiating special financing with the home seller or builder. More than one-quarter got a rate buydown from the seller or builder (see below). Nearly a quarter (23%) bought discount points, as we've just mentioned.

If mortgage rates are near 6% and you want to get below 5%, you'll need to buy four to five discount points. (Remember, each point you buy reduces your interest rate by approximately a quarter of a point.)

For example, one point on a $300,000 mortgage would equal $3,000. If you want to purchase five points, you'll likely pay $15,000. You will want to discuss your point-buying strategy with your lender to ensure it gets your long-term loan rate to your target.

5. Get an interest rate buydown

Borrowers can lower their mortgage interest rate for the first few years of the loan term with a buydown. Home builders, sellers, and some lenders sometimes offer an interest rate buydown to boost sales. However, it is a rare option among mortgage lenders.

For national mortgage lenders with buydown programs, check out Guild Mortgage and AmeriHome Mortgage.

For example, a buydown might lower your interest rate from 7% to 6.5% for two years. It can be a good deal if the company offering the buydown isn't making it up with fees somewhere else.

While you get a short-term break on the interest rate, your payments and total interest may actually be higher over the long term. Buying down your interest rate is a strategy that requires running the numbers on the long-term benefits.

If you're interested in a buydown, compare a mortgage both with and without a buydown. Lenders will qualify you based on the permanent interest rate, not the temporary buydown rate. Finally, be prepared for your monthly payment to rise at the end of the buydown’s discount period.

6. Consider an adjustable-rate mortgage

A mortgage product that increases in popularity whenever rates begin to rise is back: the adjustable-rate mortgage.

ARMs have a fixed interest rate for an introductory period, often three to 10 years, and then the rate changes regularly, usually once or twice a year. Tips when shopping for an ARM:

Look for an introductory rate that is lower than a fixed-rate mortgage.

Choose a term you feel comfortable with, perhaps in line with how long you plan to stay in the home.

Ensure you budget for potential increases in your monthly payment if the interest rate rises after the introductory fixed-rate period ends.

In the past, it was common to find ARMs with introductory rates well below the prevailing long-term fixed interest rate. An ARM could be a good idea today, but the intro rate isn't always lower anymore. You'll have to shop diligently — and bravely negotiate.

Determine how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.

7. Get a shorter-term mortgage

Are you looking for an interest rate that never changes and allows you to build home equity faster? Consider a shorter-term loan. Mortgages with 20- or 15-year fixed terms, as opposed to the traditional 30-year term, typically come with lower interest rates.

However, since the term is shorter, monthly payments tend to be higher.

8. Find an assumable mortgage

An assumable mortgage allows you to take over the remaining payments of an existing home loan. You would likely make a lump sum payment to the current owner to cover the value of any equity or for a profit. That would require you to have the needed cash on hand or perhaps get a loan.

As tempting as it might be to pick up a low-interest-rate assumable loan, most conventional mortgages aren't eligible. That means you would need to find a seller with an FHA, VA, or USDA loan.

Who has the lowest mortgage rates?

Since mortgage rates are constantly changing, and each lender's rate varies, the lowest mortgage rate you can earn requires some research. You will want to know your credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and the amount of your down payment.

With that information, you can begin contacting lenders. Knowing generally where you want to buy a house and how much it will cost, you can gather rate estimates based on your creditworthiness.

Once you have two or three contenders, you can apply for preapproval with each and get a more exact mortgage rate.

Can you get a lower interest rate on your mortgage?

Recently, home loan interest rates have been in the low-to-mid-6% range. Many (71.3%) of existing homeowners have a mortgage rate below 5%, and over half (53.4%) have a rate below 4%, according to Realtor.com. So, refinancing is not an option for many homeowners right now.

However, owning a home is a long-term commitment, and mortgage rates are very cyclical. Just because mortgage rates are above historic lows doesn't mean a refinancing opportunity will not present itself some years down the road.

After you move in, keep an eye on interest rates. Look for a dip of about 1% to 2% below your current mortgage rate before refinancing. Just remember — there will be refinance closing costs, and you need to decide if your goal is to lower your monthly payment or to pay off your home sooner.

Lowest mortgage rates FAQs

What's the lowest mortgage rate ever?

The lowest mortgage rate ever on a 30-year loan was 2.65% in January 2021, according to Freddie Mac. It takes dramatic and systemic financial stress to shock mortgage rates to such a low level. COVID-19 was just that. Some 15 months later, mortgage rates were up to 5%.

Will mortgage rates ever drop back to 3%?

Never say never — but it's unlikely that mortgage rates will go back down to 3%. A drastic event (like the COVID-19 pandemic) would have to occur again for rates to drop this low.

What mortgage loans would have the lowest rates?

VA loans, especially 15-year VA loans, usually have the lowest mortgage rates because shorter terms have lower rates than longer terms.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,How to refinance your mortgage,"When you refinance your mortgage, you replace your existing home loan with a new one for the same property. There are many reasons to refinance your home loan, from locking in a lower mortgage interest rate to tapping into your equity. Understanding the process can help you prepare and save money along the way.

6 steps to refinancing your mortgage

1. Prepare your finances

First things first: Ensure you're financially prepared to refinance.

Check your credit score and see if there are ways to improve it before refinancing. Your credit score plays a big role in your ability to get approved and will influence your interest rate.

You should also calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) and consider paying down some debts, because a lower DTI can help you more easily qualify for your loan.

Finally, ensure you have sufficient funds to comfortably cover closing costs. You can typically expect to pay 3% to 6% of the total loan amount in refinancing closing costs.

2. Choose your type of refinance

There are several types of refinances (read more about each below), and your goals for refinancing will determine which one is best for you. Do you want a lower rate or a new term? If so, a simple rate-and-term refinance may be the best option. Do you want access to cash? Go for a cash-out refinance.

Do you already have a government home loan — such as an FHA loan — and want to refinance into the same type of mortgage? A streamline refinance is probably your best bet. Knowing your goals can help point you in the right direction.

3. Pick a refinance lender

You can refinance with the same lender you used for your first mortgage, but you don't have to.

In fact, if you want the lowest rates and fees, you should shop around for mortgage refinance lenders and compare at least a few options.

The best way to do this is to fill out an application with several lenders and use the Loan Estimates each one provides to compare them. These forms detail all the fees and long-term costs of the loan, helping you zero in on the best deal.

4. Decide whether to lock in your interest rate

Some mortgage lenders offer the option to lock in your mortgage rate, ensuring it remains stable until closing day. If interest rates are trending upward, you may want to lock in your rate to avoid being stuck with a higher rate. If rates are trending downward, you can let your interest rate float in hopes of snagging a better one at closing.

Important note: Some rate locks may come with a fee — especially if you want to lock your rate for a long period of time.

5. Get an appraisal

Just like when you bought your home, you'll need to get a home appraisal when you refinance to determine the market value of your home. This helps the lender decide how much it can safely loan you.

Appraisal fees vary by location, but according to Zillow, you can typically expect to pay between $300 and $700. You may be able to avoid appraisals if you use a streamline refinance (more on these further down).

6. Close on your new mortgage

Once you have gone through all the steps, you get to close on your new mortgage. This will feel similar to when you closed on your original home loan — but maybe less exciting since you already have the keys to your house. You’ll pay your closing costs and start making payments on your new loan right away.

When to refinance your mortgage

Refinancing can help you achieve many goals. Here are times it may be a good idea to refinance your mortgage:

Interest rates have decreased

If current mortgage rates are lower than the rate on your existing mortgage, you could save money by refinancing to a lower interest rate. Your monthly payment may also be lower. This can be helpful if you’re struggling financially or simply want to increase your monthly cash flow.

If you’re able to lower your rate and keep making the same payment you’re making now, you might even be able to pay off your loan sooner. The free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below could help you estimate how much of your monthly payment would be applied to principal and interest with a lower rate.

This embedded content is not available in your region.

Your credit score has improved

Is your credit in better shape than when you bought your house? If that's the case, you may be able to lock in a lower interest rate or even qualify for a different type of loan.

For instance, with a higher credit score, you might now be eligible to refinance from an FHA loan to a conventional loan — and if you have enough home equity, eliminate paying mortgage insurance by doing so.

You want a new loan term

You can also refinance into a different loan term — one that’s shorter, longer, or even just resets your current loan term. This could help you reduce your long-term interest costs or change your monthly payment as needed.

If you were to refinance from a 30-year loan to a 15-year one, for example, you’d have a higher monthly payment, but you’d likely pay less interest over the lifetime of your loan. Refinancing into a longer term would achieve the opposite, resulting in more long-term interest but more affordable monthly payments. It all depends on your personal goals as a homeowner.

You have gained equity in your home

Your “equity” refers to your home’s value minus your remaining mortgage balance. If your home has increased in value or you just have a lot of equity at your disposal, refinancing can help you tap into that equity and turn it into cash.

For this, you’d use a cash-out refinance, which involves taking out a new mortgage larger than your current one, paying off your old loan, and receiving the remaining money as a lump sum. You can then use those funds however you like.

You need a certain amount of home equity to refinance. The exact percentage varies by refinance type and mortgage lender, but with a cash-out refinance, you’ll usually need 20%.

You can eliminate mortgage insurance

Increased home equity can also help you get rid of mortgage insurance if you’re currently paying for it.

This is because conventional mortgages don’t require private mortgage insurance (PMI) once you have at least 20% equity in the home.

So, for example, if you have an FHA loan — which typically requires mortgage insurance for the entire loan term, you could refinance into a conventional one once you hit 20%, removing FHA mortgage insurance from your loan and reducing your monthly payments in the process.

You want to switch between an adjustable-rate and a fixed-rate loan

An adjustable interest rate can often give you a lower payment at the start of your loan, but down the line, your rate and payment can increase, causing financial strain and budget issues.

Fortunately, with a refinance, you have the opportunity to change your rate type, choosing a fixed interest rate instead. This protects you from market fluctuations and ensures your rate and payment are consistent for the entire loan term.

One reason not to refinance

One time when you may not want to refinance is when you're planning to sell your home in the next few years. In that case, the benefits of refinancing may not outweigh the costs and the time involved in completing the refinance process.

You should always calculate the break-even point — or the amount of time it takes for the refinance to save you more than it costs — to determine if refinancing is financially beneficial in the long run. (For example, with a refinance that costs $5,000 and saves you $50 per month, you’d break even in 100 months — or about 8.5 years. If you won’t be in the home that long, it may not be worth the effort.)

The pros and cons of refinancing your mortgage

Getting a new mortgage isn’t right for every homeowner, so before you dive in, it’s important to weigh the pros and cons of refinancing. Here are some crucial factors to consider:

Pros

It could reduce your interest rate.

You might lower your monthly payment.

Refinancing can help you pay off your mortgage faster.

You may be able to free up cash flow.

You can turn your equity into cash.

Cons

Refinancing comes with closing costs.

It may not be worth it if you don’t plan to stay in your home long.

There may be prepayment penalties for paying off your original loan too soon.

Your credit score will probably take a small hit when you apply for a new loan.

Types of mortgage refinancing

There are several types of mortgage refinances. To decide which kind you should pursue, start by identifying the goal you hope to achieve by refinancing. This table can give you a good idea of which may be best for you. For more details, continue reading below to learn about each type of refinancing.

Rate-and-term refinance

A rate-and-term refinance replaces your current mortgage with a new one, offering a different interest rate and term length. It's a good option for those seeking a lower interest rate, a new term length, or lower monthly payments. You’d also choose this if you want to move from an adjustable-rate loan to a fixed-rate one.

Cash-out refinance

With a cash-out refinance loan, your new loan amount is significantly higher than your current loan's outstanding balance, and the difference is paid to you in cash. You can use the funds to pay off other debts, make home improvements, cover other large expenses, or anything you’d like, really.

Here are the rules for cash-out refinancing government home loans.

FHA cash-out refinance : FHA Streamlines allow you to refinance from one FHA loan to a new one. You might consider this to lower your rate, secure a new term, or switch from an adjustable rate to a fixed rate. These often require no appraisal or credit check, and they typically have fewer documentation requirements than a full refinance.

VA cash-out refinance: These cash-out refinances are only available to military members, veterans, and their spouses, and you may be able to access the full value of your property (VA loans allow for 100% financing — no down payments). When you refinance, you will need to pay the VA’s funding fee as part of your closing costs. This ranges from 2.15% to 3.3% of the loan amount, depending on how many times you’ve used the loan program.

Streamline refinance

A streamline refinance occurs when you replace your current loan with a new loan of the same type, and the paperwork and documentation requirements are simplified. Three types of loans that allow streamline refinancing are FHA loans, VA loans, and USDA loans.

FHA Streamline Refinance : FHA Streamlines allow you to refinance from one FHA loan to a new one. You might do this to lower your rate, get a new term, or change from an adjustable rate to a fixed rate. These often require no appraisal or credit check, and they typically have fewer documentation requirements than a full refinance.

VA streamline refinance (VA IRRRL) : The VA Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan, also called an IRRRL, is a type of refinance you’d use if you already had a VA loan and wanted to lower your interest rate or switch from an adjustable to a fixed rate. These require no appraisal or credit check, and they boast a faster closing process than a typical VA refinance. The funding fee on these loans is significantly lower than that of most VA loans, costing just 0.5% of the loan amount.

USDA streamlined refinance: This type of refinance would be a good fit if you have a rural home loan backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and want to refinance into a new one to achieve lower payments or a better rate. No appraisals are required on these refinances, and you can roll the USDA’s up-front guarantee fee into your new loan amount.

Cash-in refinance

A cash-in refinance is essentially the opposite of a cash-out refinance. Instead of taking out a larger mortgage and receiving cash, you put more money down when you refinance, so you can take out a smaller mortgage. This results in lower monthly payments and less interest paid over the life of the loan.

No-closing-cost refinance

As the name suggests, a no-closing-cost refinance means you don't have to pay any fees at closing. However, the lender will usually make up that money from you in one of two ways: They'll either roll the closing costs into your mortgage principal or cover the closing costs but charge you a higher interest rate in return. Only do this if you are certain the costs are worthwhile.

Short refinance

A short refinance is an option when you're underwater on your mortgage, meaning you owe more on your loan than the house is currently worth.

This type of refinance replaces your current home loan with one for less than what you owe. Your monthly payments will be lower, and you'll be able to stay in your house. Some lenders will agree to a short refinance because, although it isn't ideal, it can be a better financial deal for them than going through the foreclosure process.

Reverse mortgage

A reverse mortgage isn't technically a type of refinance, but there are some similarities. Like a cash-out refinance, you tap your home equity using a reverse mortgage. Rather than making payments to a lender to pay down your loan, you'll receive money, and your debt will increase.

A reverse mortgage is an option for senior citizens that allows them to have more money in retirement. The most common type of reverse mortgage is a home equity conversion mortgage (HECM), which is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).

How much does refinancing a mortgage cost?

When you refinance, you’ll pay many of the same closing costs you paid when you bought the house. Refinancing typically costs 3% to 6% of your loan balance. For example, if you’re refinancing into a $500,000 mortgage, expect to pay roughly $15,000 to $60,000 in closing costs.

To ensure you get the lowest possible costs, apply for prequalification or preapproval with several lenders — not just your current company. Then, compare rates and fees before deciding which company to refinance with.

How soon can you refinance your mortgage?

So, how long do you have to wait to refinance your current mortgage after buying your house (or since your last refinance)? It depends on the type of loan you have. Here is the waiting period for different types of mortgages and refinances:

Conforming loan refinance: None

Jumbo loan refinance: None

Cash-out refinance (conforming, jumbo, FHA): 12 months

VA cash-out refinance: 210 days

FHA or VA Streamline Refinance: 210 days

USDA loan refinance: 6 to 12 months, depending on the type of refinance

Even with conforming and jumbo loans that don't have a mandatory waiting period, some mortgage lenders impose a seasoning period (maybe six months or a year) before they let you refinance. The best way to get around this rule is to refinance with a different company.

How many times can you refinance your mortgage?

You can refinance your home as many times as you want. Just keep two things in mind: First, you must adhere to the aforementioned waiting periods before doing so. Second, you must pay closing costs each time you refinance, so it can become expensive if you do it multiple times.

How long does it take to refinance your home?

According to ICE Mortgage Technology, as of November, it typically takes 42 days to refinance a mortgage. To expedite the process, have your documentation — such as tax returns and bank statements — readily available when your lender requests it.

You should also respond to your lender's questions as quickly as possible to avoid delays.

Refinancing and your credit score

How to refinance with a bad credit score

You have several options for refinancing with a low credit score.

Some common tactics are pursuing a streamline refinance (which usually doesn't require a hard credit pull), adding a co-signer with a strong credit score, or choosing a mortgage lender that accepts poor credit scores. You can also work on improving your credit score before filling out your application.

Does refinancing hurt your credit score?

Refinancing may hurt your credit score because the mortgage lender will likely do a hard credit pull. However, these hard credit inquiries usually dock your score by less than five points, and although they stay on your credit report for two years, they only affect your score for one year.

Filling out multiple loan applications over a long period of time could also hurt your score, as could closing out your original mortgage account. Fortunately, as you begin paying down your new loan, your score will start to bounce back.

How to refinance a mortgage: FAQs

What is refinancing a mortgage?

Refinancing a mortgage means replacing your original mortgage loan with a new one, which could have different terms or rates. You then use the funds from your new mortgage to pay off your old one.

Is it a good idea to refinance your mortgage?

Refinancing a mortgage can be a good idea if it will help you financially. For example, if you can get a lower mortgage rate by refinancing, you could save money on your monthly payments and pay less in interest in the long run. However, it's usually not a good idea to refinance if you plan to move soon, as the amount you save likely won't offset the up-front closing costs.

How much does it cost to refinance a $300,000 mortgage?

When you refinance a mortgage, you’ll typically pay 2% to 6% of the loan amount. On a $300,000 mortgage, this totals between $6,000 and $18,000. To pay near the lower end, shop around for lenders that offer a combination of the lowest refinance rates and the most competitive mortgage lender fees. If you have a strong financial profile, you may even be able to negotiate for lower lender fees, such as a waived application fee or reduced origination fee.

Is it difficult to refinance a mortgage?

It can be hard to refinance a mortgage if you're in a tough financial spot because you might not get the terms you want. Otherwise, refinancing isn't necessarily more difficult than obtaining your original mortgage. Lenders typically require a specific credit score, loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and debt-to-income ratio (DTI), although these requirements vary by company and loan program.

What is the process of refinancing your mortgage?

First, check your credit score and ensure you’re financially ready to refinance. Then, choose the type of refinance that will help you reach your goals, such as a cash-out or streamline refinance. You should shop around with several lenders to see which will offer you the lowest rates and fees, and decide whether you want to lock in your interest rate or — if rates are decreasing — leave it floating until closing time. Finally, you’ll schedule a home appraisal before finally closing on your new home loan.

Is there a penalty to refinance your mortgage?

That depends on your mortgage lender. In some cases, you may be charged a prepayment penalty if you refinance your loan too quickly after taking it out. Keep in mind that even if your lender doesn’t charge these fees, there are still costs to refinancing. You will typically pay between 3% and 6% of the loan amount in closing costs.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,How to buy a house: A guide for first-time home buyers in 2025,"If you’re a first-time home buyer, you'll want to understand each step of buying a house, as well as your loan options and exclusive benefits as a first-time buyer.

This embedded content is not available in your region.

What is a first-time home buyer?

To qualify for special home buyer benefits, borrowers purchasing a single-family home as a primary residence are defined as “first-time home buyers” in one of three ways:

You've never purchased a single-family home before. You haven't owned a home in the last three years, including sole or joint ownership. You're a displaced homemaker or single parent who has never owned a home other than jointly with a spouse in the last three years.

In addition, eligibility requirements for a first-time home buyer loan will typically include a steady household income and a manageable debt load. More on that later.

How buying your first home works: Step by step

1. Know how much house you can afford

As Step 1, you'll want to determine how much house you can afford comfortably. If you properly gauge your financial capacity, your monthly mortgage payment will feel right from the beginning and get even easier to make over time.

Divide your gross (pre-tax) monthly salary by four. That's a good start for a target monthly payment. But that's not just principal and interest payments. You will also want to include property taxes and homeowners insurance in the total.

Mortgage lenders often recommend that your housing costs total around 28% of your gross pay. That calculation is known as your debt-to-income ratio (DTI).

This embedded content is not available in your region.

Don’t forget to figure in closing costs. These costs include (but aren’t limited to) things like your appraisal and home inspection fees, loan origination costs, and title insurance, and they generally cost between 2% and 5% of your home’s purchase price. Here’s an example:

Say you’re buying a $500,000 home. Your closing costs will be 2% to 5% of the total, or between $10,000 and $25,000.

There are several ways to reduce your closing costs. You can often save thousands by simply comparing multiple lenders, looking for those offering lender credits, and negotiating directly with your lender.

2. Shop mortgage lenders

Over the last 10-plus years, more than 60% of home buyers said they shopped more than one lender, according to Fannie Mae research. Gone are the days when buyers just went with a real estate agent's ""preferred lender,"" no questions asked. Comparison shopping to find the best mortgage lenders for first-time home buyers with the best rate and most favorable fees will help you get the best deal.

When comparing lenders, it’s important to look beyond the advertised annual percentage rate (APR) for your preferred loan. You’ll want to compare key criteria that impact your total loan experience.

For example, look at each company’s mortgage origination fee. Search for lenders with low to no origination fees to help keep costs down.

Again, don't forget to consider the total closing costs. Comparing Loan Estimates from all lenders will help uncover costs beyond your monthly mortgage payment so you can find the lender with the lowest interest rate and total loan costs.

3. Shop for a home

Now for the fun part: looking at houses.

Make a list of what you’re looking for in a house, including the “must haves” and “would be nice to haves.”

Attend some open houses and scour the local market for neighborhoods and amenities that best suit you. Find a couple of contenders: one to make an offer on and some backup options if your favorite falls through.

Your buyer's agent will handle the details of making an official offer and negotiating counteroffers.

4. Select your mortgage lender

With an offer in hand, you can get real-deal loan offers. Each lender vying for your business will give you a written offer.

Ask each lender to provide you with a zero-discount-points offer. This way, you can compare apples to apples to truly find the best mortgage lender for your situation — and then decide if you want to buy mortgage discount points to lower your interest rate.

Once your offer is accepted and your loan is approved, you can move forward with the home appraisal, inspection, and other steps before closing.

5. Prepare to close the loan

Three days before closing, you'll receive an official Closing Disclosure form detailing the mortgage interest and up-front fees you'll pay.

Then, signing day arrives, and you close on the house.

First-time home buyer perks

If you're looking to buy a house in 2025 or aiming for homeownership in early 2026, a lower down payment and credit-score flexibility are two of the biggest breaks you get.

Down payment and closing costs assistance

While 20% down has been the historical goal — because it eliminates private mortgage insurance, a fee to protect lenders from a default — first-time home buyers can make a minimum down payment of 3% of the home purchase price (and some lenders buy that down to 1%).

Another big benefit of being a first-timer: government and nonprofit first-time home buyer programs that provide closing costs and down payment assistance. These loan programs empower potential homeowners from all walks of life: teachers, first responders, Native American borrowers, public housing residents, and low- and middle-income households.

While many programs involve loans or tax credits, you might also qualify for a first-time home buyer grant that you don't have to repay.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development offers resources for first-time home buyers to find assistance programs they may be eligible for. State housing finance agencies can also provide additional information on homeownership programs.

Some employers also offer homeownership assistance for employees trying to buy their first home. Ask your human resources rep if your company offers any such programs.

Credit score breaks

Is a low credit score making it hard to qualify for a mortgage? Good news: First-time home buyers can get an FHA loan with a FICO credit score as low as 500 with 10% down, or a conventional loan with a score as low as 620.

To qualify for a more expensive home loan, called a jumbo mortgage, you'll need a FICO 700.

You need a score of 760 or better to get the most favorable interest rate on any product.

A good lender will walk you through all the types of mortgage programs you qualify for.

Education

Home buyer education courses are also available to first-timers and can help you discover and understand the process for buying a house.

First-time home buyer challenges

Mortgage rates — historically average but higher than in recent memory — remain a sticking point for many first-time buyers. In the just-below-7% range, current homeowners aren't looking to move and lose what is likely a significantly lower interest rate.

That's worsening the 3.8 million-unit housing supply shortage. As a result, Realtor.com estimates that a lack of affordable housing prevents 1.6 million Gen Z and millennial would-be buyers or renters from forming households.

Home prices have risen drastically in the last few years, but are beginning to moderate.

Finally, saving for a down payment stymies many first-time buyers. That can be blamed on recent high inflation, rising home prices, and lagging income growth.

Best types of mortgages for first-time home buyers

If this is your first time buying a home, consider one of the following types of home loans to finance your purchase:

FHA loans

FHA loans can be great for first-time buyers who may not have had time to pay down debts or build up credit yet. You only need a 580 credit score and 3.5% down payment (or a 500 credit score with 10% down). You can also have a DTI ratio of up to 43%.

VA loans

VA loans are great choices for military personnel and their families. You don't need any down payment.

USDA loans

You might qualify for a USDA loan if you're a low-to-moderate-income buyer in a rural area. USDA loans don't require down payments, either.

HomeReady and Home Possible loans

HomeReady (by Fannie Mae) and Home Possible (by Freddie Mac) are two mortgage programs that let you get a mortgage with just 3% down — and you may not need a minimum qualifying credit score.

First-time home buyer guide FAQs

How much do most first-time home buyers put down?

A 2024 report by the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) stated that the typical down payment for first-time home buyers in 2024 was 9%. This is much lower than repeat buyers, with a typical down payment of 23%.

What qualifies you as a first-time home buyer?

There are three ways to qualify as a first-time home buyer: You have never bought a single-family home before, you haven't owned a home in the last three years, or you're a displaced homemaker/single parent who hasn't owned a home in the last three years (unless it was joint ownership with a spouse).

Which loan is best for a first-time home buyer?

An FHA loan is the best option for many first-time buyers because it accepts lower credit scores and higher debt-to-income ratios (DTIs) than many other types of mortgages.

What do first-time home buyers get?

First-time home buyer benefits vary by lender. Some mortgage lenders have down payment assistance programs that are only available to first-time buyers. Others allow for lower down payments on conventional loans — for example, a lender may require 5% down for repeat buyers but only 3% down for first-timers.

What are first-time buyer education courses?

Some mortgage programs require first-time home buyers to take an educational course so they're informed and prepared for homeownership. For example, HomeReady by Fannie Mae and Home Possible by Freddie Mac both have first-time buyers take online education courses.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,House Affordability Calculator,"Knowing how much house you can afford is a matter of comparing your financial situation to the factors lenders consider when approving a mortgage application. Those include a steady income, adequate savings for the down payment and closing costs, the amount of debt you carry, and your repayment history.

However, the amount of money you are approved to borrow with a mortgage and how much house you can comfortably afford can be two very different numbers. Lenders want to make loans for the highest dollar they feel comfortable with based on certain elements of a borrower’s personal finances. That's a business decision.

For you, affordability is a quality-of-life calculation. Only you know your comfort level with all of the expenses due each month.

Run the calculations in the home affordability calculator above, then aim lower than the maximum results to give you a financial cushion. Armed with this information, you can determine which type of mortgage you might qualify for — and, more importantly, how much house you can afford.

Using a home affordability calculator

Knowing your target loan amount will help you determine how much house you can afford. In this formula, you'll use:

Your gross monthly income (before taxes and deductions)

Your monthly debt, such as vehicle and student loans and credit cards

The down payment you have saved

The loan term (e.g., 15-year versus 30-year mortgage)

The interest rate you'll qualify for

Your credit score

A sample mortgage affordability calculation could be:

Gross annual income: $70,000 (or about $5,800 per month)

Your monthly debt: $250

Down payment: $20,000

Loan term: 30 years

Interest rate: 6.5%

Once you factor in payments for private mortgage insurance (PMI), homeowners insurance, and property taxes, such a calculation might yield the result of qualifying for a mortgage up to $213,808, with a home a monthly payment of $2,100.

If you buy a place with a homeowners' association that charges dues, you will also pay a little more each month.

Dig deeper: How much house can you afford with a $70,000 salary?

How to know what price house you can afford

When you’re determining your house budget, ask yourself two crucial questions: First, how much house can you afford up-front? Second, how much house can you afford in the long-term? The up-front costs consist of your down payment and closing costs, and the longer-term expenses refer to your monthly payments and cash reserves.

Down payment

Your down payment is the amount you pay in cash when you buy the house. Let’s say you buy a $400,000 home with a $20,000 down payment. Then, you’ll take out a mortgage for the remaining $380,000.

Here are the minimum down payments for the most common types of mortgage loans:

Use these minimums to determine your true home affordability. For example, if you don’t have 3% of $400,000 — or $12,000 — you probably can’t get a conforming loan, not to mention a jumbo or FHA loan. If you don’t qualify for a USDA or VA loan, then you now know that you should buy a less expensive home. Or save more before buying.

Learn more: What is a down payment, and how does it work?

Closing costs

It’s easy to forget about closing costs when calculating your home-buying budget. The exact amount varies, but you can typically expect to pay 2% to 5% of your loan amount in closing costs.

So, let’s say you want to buy a $400,000 home with a conforming mortgage. You’ll need $12,000 for a down payment and 2% to 5% of the amount you’re borrowing ($388,000), which is $7,760 to $19,400. This means you’ll need a total of $19,760 to $31,400 to realistically afford the house on closing day.

Closing costs vary by mortgage lender but include expenses like a home appraisal, inspection, title search fees, credit report checks, and more.

Cash reserves

You probably don't want to spend every last dime on your down payment and closing costs. Then you risk becoming what's known as ""house poor."" You should still have three to six months of expenses in an emergency fund, and ideally, you’d have some extra money set aside for inevitable house repairs or things you want to buy for the house, like furniture or decorations to make the space feel like yours.

Monthly mortgage payments

Now that you’re a homeowner, you’ll need to make sure you can comfortably afford the monthly payments. Use our calculator to see how much you can realistically afford. You don’t want to struggle to make your payments each month. In this case, your quality of life could suffer — and you could even end up losing your home in foreclosure.

Your debt-to-income ratio is important to lenders

In addition to your salary, savings, and repayment history, debt-to-income ratio is one of the most important factors lenders use in determining the home loan you qualify for — and the interest rate you'll be charged.

How to calculate your DTI

To start, you'll need three things to calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI):

Your monthly gross income, which is before any deductions for benefits, retirement savings, taxes, and the like. The monthly total of debt payments. That would include the minimum amount due for credit cards, student loan payments, car loans, and other monthly debt payments. Your estimated monthly mortgage payment.

Next, you'll divide your debt by your income.

A sample calculation:

Monthly debt (including your mortgage): $2,000. Gross monthly income: $5,000. DTI: 2,000 / 5,000 = 0.40.

The 28/36 DTI rule

Another clue to examining home affordability is the 28/36 rule. Lenders use this to zero in on what you currently owe and how a mortgage will impact that debt load. It can help you determine what percentage of your income should go to a mortgage.

28% is the maximum total of your housing expenses. This is known as the front-end debt-to-income ratio, which is your mortgage, property taxes, and homeowners' insurance. Housing costs / income = front-end ratio.

You can reverse the calculation and multiply your income by 0.28 to determine a target mortgage payment.

36% is the limit to your total debt, including the mortgage and existing loans and credit balances. It's called the back-end debt-to-income ratio. All debt / income = back-end ratio.

Tip: Mortgage lenders have flexibility for well-qualified buyers. If you have a decent down payment and a credit score on the high end, they might stretch your back-end ratio as high as the low 40s. However, you will likely also pay a higher interest rate.

How much house can you afford with different types of mortgages?

How much house can I afford with a conventional loan?

Many lenders allow you to get a conventional loan with just 3% down. They usually prefer a DTI ratio of 41% or less, but you might qualify with a ratio as high as 50%. A conventional loan is a great option if you can afford a 20% down payment, because then you won't have to pay for PMI.

How much house can I afford with an FHA loan?

You can get an FHA loan with a down payment as low as 3.5%, as long as you have a minimum 580 credit score. You'll also need a DTI of 43% or lower.

It's important to factor in the cost of FHA mortgage insurance premiums (MIPs). Unlike conventional loans, you cannot avoid MIPs by making a large down payment. Except in special circumstances, you'll likely pay MIPs for the life of the loan — keep this in mind when thinking about monthly mortgage payments.

How much house can I afford with a VA loan?

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doesn't require a down payment on VA loans. Some VA mortgage lenders might ask for a down payment, particularly if other parts of your financial profile aren't super strong. Many lenders also prefer a DTI ratio of 50% or lower.

A zero-down-payment mortgage can be a great way to get your foot in the door as a homeowner, especially as a first-time home buyer. Just remember that the lower your down payment, the higher your monthly payment. While it may be easier to afford a mortgage up-front with 0% down, it could make finances more difficult in the long run.

How much house can I afford with a USDA loan?

The U.S. Department of Agriculture also doesn't require a down payment. It also doesn't set a minimum DTI ratio requirement, though many lenders prefer your ratio to be 41% or lower for a USDA loan.

As with VA loans, remember that a 0% down payment makes homeownership more affordable at first, but it results in higher monthly payments. Both are crucial factors to consider when determining how much home you can afford.

Determining true home affordability

You're buying a house. The lender is selling a mortgage. With that perspective, it's easy to understand that only you can determine true affordability. You have to make the monthly home loan payments. And you may want to travel, buy new furniture, buy a new car, save for the future — or a hundred other things.

So, a lender might approve you for a loan to buy too much house with a too-large payment. Your sense of what you can really afford may convince you to buy a house at a more reasonable purchase price with lower payments.

That's being in control of home affordability.

House affordability FAQs

How can I increase how much home I can afford?

Having a healthy savings stash helps build your home purchasing power. That means you can make a decent down payment and show that money is set aside for not only your housing payment but all of your monthly debt, including a car payment, credit card debt, and living expenses. A good credit report not only impacts how much home you can afford but also helps you qualify for a lower interest rate.

What costs do I need to consider when buying a home?

In addition to the mortgage loan payment, insurance premiums, and taxes, you’ll want to consider things like HOA fees, and if you put less than 20% down on a conventional loan, you’ll likely have to pay private mortgage insurance. There are also everyday expenses to factor in, such as transportation costs, childcare, or furniture for your new home.

How do I know when I’m ready to apply for a mortgage?

One big clue to knowing you are in a good place financially to buy a home is when your current monthly expenses are well in hand. That means you have a comfortable household income, are well on top of credit card payments, and have set aside some cash for unexpected expenses. Your total monthly debt is within the DTI parameters we mentioned above. And your annual income is steady and perhaps even expected to grow in the years ahead.

Cheapest full coverage car insurance

Full coverage car insurance usually refers to a combination of liability, collision, and comprehensive insurance. However, it can also include other coverage options, such as uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage and rental car reimbursement coverage.

At $151 per month, American Family and Farm Bureau offer the cheapest car insurance for full coverage.

Cheapest car insurance with one speeding ticket

Getting a speeding ticket doesn’t guarantee you’ll have to pay more for car insurance. Some insurers don’t raise rates after a first offense.

However, if your car insurance premium goes up after a speeding ticket, you might find cheaper insurance with one of the companies below. Rates are based on estimates for full coverage insurance for an average policyholder with one speeding ticket.

How to get the cheapest car insurance

There are plenty of ways to bring down the cost of car insurance. Take these steps to get the best possible price on the coverage you need.

Step 1: Get the right type of coverage

You can keep the cost of car insurance low by buying only the minimum amount of liability coverage required by your state. However, this strategy can backfire. Liability coverage pays only for property damage and injuries to others if you cause an accident. It doesn’t cover repairs to your vehicle, leaving you on the hook for those costs.

It can save you money in the long run to spend a little more each month to add collision insurance and comprehensive insurance to your coverage. Collision coverage insurance pays for repairs or replacement after an accident, and comprehensive insurance pays if your car is stolen or damaged by something other than an accident with another vehicle, such as a storm or vandalism.

Learn more: Most common types of car insurance explained

Step 2: Opt for a higher deductible

Your car insurance deductible is the amount you pay to repair or replace your car before collision or comprehensive coverage kicks in. Opting for a higher deductible can lower your car insurance cost. For example, increasing your deductible for collision and comprehensive from $200 to $500 can reduce your rate by as much as 30%, according to III. Just make sure you have enough in an emergency fund to cover your deductible.

Step 3: Shop around for the lowest quotes

It pays to get quotes from multiple insurance companies because each insurer has its own methodology for setting car insurance premiums. As a result, quotes for comparable policies can be substantially different.

There are several ways to comparison shop for car insurance quotes:

Online car insurance comparison tools show car insurance premiums from different insurers and let you compare prices for similar policies.

Car insurance websites allow you to expand your search to companies that aren’t featured in online comparison tools.

Independent insurance agents can do the comparison shopping for you by getting quotes from several companies.

Captive insurance agents only sell products from a single insurance company, such as Allstate, Nationwide, and State Farm.

Multi-policy discount. Most insurers offer a discount if you buy more than one insurance policy, such as auto and home or auto and renters insurance.

Low mileage discount . Many car insurance companies offer discounts if you drive less than the average number of miles per year. If you put relatively few miles on your car, explore pay-per-mile car insurance.

Safe driver discount. You can get a lower rate if you haven’t had any accidents or moving violations in a certain number of years.

Anti-theft device discount. Several car insurance companies offer a security discount for having an anti-theft device or technology to protect your car.

Good student discount. Many insurers offer good student discounts for high school and college students with a high GPA.

Defensive driving discount. Young drivers and seniors may get lower rates by taking an approved safe driving course.

Military discount. A variety of insurers offer special discounts for serving in the military.

Loyalty discount. Some insurers offer discounts for staying with them for a certain number of years, which can be worthwhile if you can’t save money by switching companies.

Autopay discount. You might get a discount by setting up automatic premium payments. Opting for electronic statements rather than paper also might save you money.

Payment in full discount. Save money by paying for six months or a year of coverage at once instead of monthly.

Step 5: Don’t focus on monthly price alone

There’s more to choosing the right auto insurance policy than cost alone. Trying to secure the most affordable car insurance policy might save money up front, but could lead to higher costs if coverage is inadequate.

Ask about any coverage restrictions before buying a policy. For example, will your coverage level drop if you drive outside of your state? Will your insurance cover a friend if they get into an accident when borrowing your car?

Also, check online reviews and complaints for insurers you’re considering to find a company with a good customer service track record.

Step 6: Review your coverage annually

Review your car insurance coverage each year to ensure you’re getting all discounts you qualify for and not paying more than necessary. For example, if your income has increased, you might be able to afford a higher deductible, which will lower your premium.

Also, use your annual check-in to get quotes from other insurers to see if you can get a lower rate elsewhere. However, make sure to account for the loss of any discounts with your current insurer before switching.

Methodology

Unless stated otherwise, the estimates above are generated by Trellis’ in-house machine learning models based on over 3 million data points, and include more than 15 of the largest insurance companies in Trellis’ nationwide data set. This includes data from more than 2 million insurance accounts connected through Trellis Connect, an in-house technology allowing consumers to “link” their insurance accounts before searching for insurance, and tens of thousands of policies bound by Trellis’ own agents. It takes into account a myriad of factors to create predictions, such as:

Policyholder age

Number of vehicles

ZIP code

Vehicle age

Insurer

And more

Trellis creates estimates by running models against multiple inputs to the parameters of interest. For instance, the “teen driver” estimates were created by adjusting the policyholder age input into the pricing model while keeping all other variables steady from the baseline for “full coverage.” The models enable hyper-personalized estimates that take into account a plethora of user attribute permutations (e.g., teen drivers in specific states, teen drivers with new vehicles, teen drivers in specific states with new vehicles) to provide individuals with a unique and tailored experience. The charts above are a subset of the kinds of personalization Trellis can do.

Definitions

The following are definitions used by Trellis when providing its rate estimates for various types of coverage.

Full coverage car insurance: A policy with comprehensive, collision, and liability coverage

Average policyholder: A 48-year-old driver who owns a 13-year-old vehicle and lives in an average-income ZIP code

Senior driver: A 70-year-old policyholder with full coverage car insurance

Good driver: Drivers across all coverage types, vehicle types, and locations who have no tickets, accidents, or DUIs","['Cameron Huddleston', 'October', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Most common types of car insurance explained,"Car insurance is a financial safety net that saves you from paying the full expenses that arise after a car accident, vandalism, storm damage, theft or other problems. There are multiple types of car insurance you can purchase that will cover your vehicle, yourself, your passengers, and others on the road.

Understanding the various types of car insurance coverage and when they pay out will help you decide what coverage is right for you.

6 main types of car insurance

While many types of auto insurance are optional, some are required based on where you live and if you’re leasing or financing your vehicle. These are the six major types of auto insurance.

1. Collision insurance

Collision insurance covers damages to your vehicle due to an accident – whether you’ve collided with another car or hit a tree or telephone poll in a single-car accident. If your car is beyond repair, collision insurance will reimburse you based on the actual cash value of your vehicle – minus your deductible. Collision insurance is not state-mandated but is usually required if you’re financing or leasing your car.

2. Comprehensive insurance

With comprehensive insurance , your insurance company will pay for your car to be repaired or replaced following non-collision incidents, such as vandalism, theft or damage from natural disasters, such as floods. Comprehensive coverage also covers damage to your vehicle if you’ve hit an animal on the road. This type of insurance isn’t mandatory but also is often required by your lender or leasing company if you have a car loan or lease.

Read more: Does car insurance cover flood damage?

3. Liability insurance

Liability insurance pays for medical expenses and car repair costs for others in accidents you cause. It won’t cover your bills, but rather the expenses of the person or people you hit. Every state except New Hampshire and Virginia requires drivers to purchase – and maintain – liability insurance when they register a vehicle. It typically has two components, bodily injury liability and property damage liability coverage. Required minimum liability limits vary by state.

4. Medical payments (MedPay)

Medical payments insurance – also known as MedPay – covers injury-related expenses for you and your passengers following an accident, even if you were at fault. It can help pay for ambulance fees, health insurance deductibles, and funeral costs in addition to your regular doctor’s bills or hospital bills. MedPay is only required in three states but most states offer it as optional coverage. It is similar to personal injury protection insurance coverage but less comprehensive.

5. Personal injury protection

Personal injury protection – also known as PIP – is insurance that covers injury-related expenses for you and your passengers if you’re in an accident, regardless of who is at fault. In addition to your medical costs, it can cover lost wages, at-home care, childcare costs, and funeral expenses. Personal injury coverage is required in 12 states, including “no-fault” states where drivers are required to file a claim with their own insurance company after an accident, even if they didn’t cause it. For this reason, PIP is sometimes referred to as no-fault insurance . PIP is optional in some states and not available in others.

6. Uninsured motorist insurance/underinsured motorist insurance

Uninsured motorist insurance covers bills from your injuries – and property damage, depending on the type of coverage – if you get in an accident caused by someone who does not have auto insurance, aka an uninsured driver. Underinsured motorist insurance is similar, but it helps to cover your expenses when you’re in an accident caused by someone who doesn’t have enough insurance. Nearly half of all U.S. states require drivers to have uninsured motorist coverage. Uninsured motorist coverage is sometimes bundled with underinsured motorist coverage.

Additional types of auto insurance coverage

Alongside the main types of car insurance, are additional options to further protect yourself and your vehicle or specialized coverage to fit unique situations..

Accident forgiveness

Accident forgiveness , an extra option offered by some insurance companies, prevents your car insurance rates from increasing after an accident.

Auto glass insurance

Auto glass insurance is optional coverage you can add on to your car insurance policy to cover repairing or replacing a damaged or broken windshield. Depending on the incident, windshield damage could be covered under collision or comprehensive insurance or under the at-fault driver’s liability insurance.

Car storage insurance

If you store your car for a long period without driving it, you might reduce your coverage down to comprehensive insurance and the minimum amount of coverage your state requires. Sometimes this strategy is referred to as “ car storage insurance .”

Classic car insurance

Classic car insurance covers bodily injury and property damage liability for vehicles considered classic, collectible, or antique. This type of insurance typically includes limitations on how often the car can be driven and requires the vehicle to be securely stored.

Collision damage waiver insurance

A collision damage waiver covers damage to a car while you’re renting it. You can buy the coverage at the rental car counter. Generally the insurance pays for repairs if the car is damaged in an accident, the windshield is chipped, or the vehicle is hit in a parking lot. In some cases it may cover the vehicle if it’s stolen. If your own car insurance policy covers rental cars, then you may not need to purchase a collision damage waiver.

Credit card rental car insurance

Credit card rental car insurance is a benefit offered by some credit cards to cover rental cars. You have to charge the entire rental cost on the card to activate the coverage. Not all credit cards offer this benefit, and the coverage terms vary, so check your card’s guidelines for details.

Custom parts and equipment insurance

Custom parts and equipment insurance – also known as CPE coverage – covers modifications you make to your car to enhance its appearance or performance. If you’ve added custom rims, a new speaker system, tinted windows, or a special paint job, these enhancements would not be covered under a standard auto policy unless you’ve added CPE coverage.

Delivery drivers insurance or rideshare insurance

If you work as a delivery driver or rideshare driver, your personal auto insurance policy probably won’t cover you if you get into an accident while making a delivery, transporting passengers, or waiting in between gigs. You may need to purchase add-on delivery drivers insurance or rideshare insurance if you’re not covered under an employer's commercial insurance policy. Even if your rideshare company provides insurance coverage, there may be instances – such as when you’re waiting to pick up your next passenger or accept your next delivery – when you wouldn’t be covered.

Emergency roadside assistance

You can add emergency roadside assistance to your auto insurance policy to get help if you’re stranded on the road. This coverage typically provides towing services, tire change services, battery services, fuel delivery, locksmith services, and more. You could also choose to get emergency roadside assistance through an organization such as AAA , or it may be included as a perk from your credit card company or cell phone provider.

EV car insurance

If you drive an electric vehicle, you won’t need to purchase special EV car insurance. A standard insurance policy – which could include liability coverage, collision coverage, comprehensive coverage, and more – will help you cover the costs of injuries, auto repairs or vehicle replacement if you’re in an accident or your car is stolen or damaged. But be prepared: Because electric vehicles tend to have newer technology that is costly to replace and difficult to source, insuring them generally costs more.

Learn more: The reasons electric car insurance will cost you more. Here's how to save .

Forced-placed car insurance

Forced-placed insurance is a temporary policy that a lender purchases on a vehicle when a borrower doesn’t obtain sufficient coverage. Most auto loan contracts require borrowers to purchase collision and comprehensive insurance to cover vehicle theft or damage. Forced-place insurance protects the lender’s interests, and the cost is added to the borrower’s monthly loan payments.

Gap insurance

Gap insurance – which stands for guaranteed asset protection insurance – helps minimize your financial loss if your car is totaled or stolen and you owe more than your vehicle is worth. Standard insurance policies only pay out up to your car’s current value, which might be much less than your auto loan balance, thanks to depreciation.

Learn more: What is the actual cash value of my car? Here’s what to know .

Mechanical breakdown insurance

Mechanical breakdown insurance — similar to a dealer’s extended warranty — pays for repairs when a major component of the car malfunctions, such as the transmission, suspension, engine, drivetrain, air conditioning, or heating. The coverage is usually limited to new and lightly used vehicles and requires you to keep up with routine maintenance outlined in the car’s owner’s manual.

New car replacement insurance

New car replacement insurance reimburses you for the purchase price of a new car if your vehicle is totaled in an accident or event covered by your collision or comprehensive insurance. Normally collision or comprehensive coverage pays out the actual cash value of your vehicle if it’s totaled. Insurers that offer new car replacement insurance restrict the coverage to vehicles that are relatively new, anywhere from one to five years old, depending on the company.

Non-owners car insurance

Non-owners car insurance provides basic liability coverage for a driver who doesn't own a vehicle and isn’t included as a named driver under another driver’s policy but frequently rents or borrows someone’s car. Additional coverage, such as medical payments coverage, personal injury protection and uninsured motorist coverage, may be added to a non-owners car insurance policy for more complete protection.

Rental car reimbursement

If your car needs to stay at the repair shop following an accident, you can use rental car reimbursement to cover the costs of a rental car (or other options such as rideshare services or public transportation). Your insurance company may require you to have comprehensive and collision insurance in order to add on rental reimbursement coverage.

Usage-based insurance

Usage-based insurance programs track your driving patterns to help determine your car insurance price. The programs typically require you to use a plug-in device, smartphone app, or your vehicle’s OnStar (or similar system) to monitor your driving. The data is transmitted to the insurance company. There are two types of programs – pay-per-mile and pay-how-you-drive.

Pay-per-mile insurance can help infrequent drivers save money on car insurance, but not all insurance companies offer it. Rather than paying a flat car insurance rate based on the cost of your annual policy, you’ll pay two separate rates: one based on your demographics and a second on your usage (or per mile), which is tracked using a telematics device that plugs into your vehicle. The per-mile rate you pay can fluctuate depending how much you drive.

Pay-how-you-drive programs consider your mileage as well as your driving behavior, such as acceleration rate, braking habits, and smartphone usage to determine your car insurance price.

Common types of car insurance FAQs

How much car insurance do I need?

The amount of car insurance you’ll need will depend on where you live, whether you own your car outright, and your financial ability to cover accident-related costs. Each state has its own requirements for car insurance coverage. If you’re leasing or financing your vehicle, there may be additional requirements. You should also consider how much money you’d feel comfortable spending out of pocket should you get into a non-covered accident and have injuries or property damage.

What is full coverage insurance?

When people talk about full coverage insurance , they typically mean a combination of liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage. This provides a wide range of financial protection to cover medical bills and car repair costs following a car accident or other damage to your vehicle. Additional coverage – such as uninsured motorist coverage, personal injury protection, and medical payments coverage – can be added onto your policy and may even be required depending on your state.

What happens if I don’t have car insurance?

If you’re caught driving without car insurance , you could be fined, have your vehicle impounded, get your license suspended, or potentially face jail time, depending on your state laws. In some cases, you may have to file a SR-22 form with your state, which serves as a certificate of financial responsibility. You can likely expect higher car insurance premiums after an SR-22 filing or when you get a new policy after having a lapse in coverage.

What factors go into my car insurance premium?

Auto insurance companies use a variety of factors to determine your car insurance premium. The vehicle you drive, the types of insurance coverage you need, your driving record and insurance claims history certainly play a big role. Depending on the laws in your state, other non-driving-related criteria – including your age, gender, marital status, credit history, and ZIP code – can also affect how much you pay for car insurance. Each company has its own method for determining your rates, so get insurance quotes from multiple providers to find the best and cheapest car insurance.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,The total guide to life insurance,"Life insurance is a contract between an insurance company and a policyholder where the insurer agrees to pay a lump sum of money if the insured person dies during a covered period in exchange for premium payments. If you have people who depend on you financially, you probably need life insurance.

In this article, we’ll cover the types of life insurance policies, the benefits of life insurance and how to get coverage. But first, to understand how life insurance works, you need to understand a few key terms.

Life insurance policy: The agreement between the insurance company and the policyholder to insure someone’s life.

Policyholder or policy owner: The person who owns the life insurance policy. Typically, this is the person whose life is insured.

Death benefit: The sum of money the insurer pays out when the covered person dies.

Beneficiary: The individual who receives the death benefit payout when the insured person passes. You can have a single beneficiary or multiple beneficiaries.

Premiums: The monthly or annual payments the policyholder pays to keep the policy in force.

Policy riders: Optional add-ons to a life insurance policy that are available for an extra cost.

Types of life insurance policies

There are two basic types of life insurance policies: term life insurance and permanent life insurance. The key difference is that term insurance only covers you for a specified period of time, whereas permanent life insurance covers you for your entire life. Also, permanent life insurance policies have a savings component called cash value, whereas term policies don’t.

Term life insurance

A term life policy pays a death benefit only if you die within a certain period, i.e., 20 years or 30 years. If you don’t die during the term, the policy expires without paying out money. Term life insurance policies don’t accumulate cash value. However, premiums are much cheaper than permanent life insurance premiums.

Whole life insurance

Whole life insurance is the most common type of permanent life insurance. Also referred to as ordinary life insurance, these policies offer a guaranteed death benefit, plus cash value that grows at a rate guaranteed by your insurer. If you choose what’s called a participating policy, the insurer may also pay dividends. For all these benefits, you’ll pay a higher premium.

Universal life insurance

Universal life insurance is a type of permanent coverage that’s more flexible than whole life coverage. You can adjust the premiums (within limits) and your death benefit as your financial situation and needs change. The insurer guarantees a minimum cash value growth, but the interest you earn will vary based on money market rates.

Variable life insurance

Like universal life insurance, variable life insurance offers flexible premium payments and death benefits, but you’re allowed to invest the policy’s cash value in underlying sub-accounts similar to mutual funds. Because the cash value is linked to financial market performance, variable life policies are riskier than other life insurance options.

How life insurance works

When you apply for a policy, the life insurance company will review your medical records and often require a physical exam to determine how risky of an applicant you are. Essentially, they’re assessing the likelihood that you’ll die during the covered period. The underwriting process determines how much coverage you qualify for and how much you’ll pay.

You’ll pay your premiums at regular intervals, i.e., monthly, quarterly or annually. If you miss premium payments, your policy could eventually lapse. Your premiums go toward:

Insurer expenses: The portion that goes toward the insurer’s business expenses and profits.

Cost of insurance: The amount that’s used to pay for death benefits.

Cash value: If you have permanent life insurance (but not term insurance), part of your premium goes toward the cash value component. You can use the cash value to make partial withdrawals, take a policy loan, pay your premiums or withdraw it all and surrender the policy.

Regardless of what type of policy you have, the death benefit is generally income tax-free for your beneficiaries. If you have permanent life insurance, your cash value grows on a tax-deferred basis as long as the policy is in force. You can take tax-free loans or withdrawals against the policy if the amount you take out isn’t more than your cost basis, i.e., what you paid in premiums.

Purpose and benefits of life insurance

The most important reason you’d want to buy life insurance is to avoid putting a financial burden on your loved ones when you die. Beyond that peace of mind, some specific reasons for buying life insurance include:

Paying for final expenses. The median cost of a funeral with a viewing and burial was $7,848 in 2021, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. Life insurance — and specifically burial insurance — can help your loved ones pay for these costs and other final expenses.

Income replacement. Buying life insurance can help replace your income if you die, allowing those who financially depend on you to maintain their standard of living. Some people also opt for a death benefit that would cover the cost of their children’s education and/or college tuition.

Paying off a mortgage or other debt. Obtaining a policy with a large enough benefit to pay off your mortgage and any other debt after you die provides financial protection for your partner or spouse. If you have debt that someone else cosigned for, you might consider buying life insurance for at least that amount so they won’t be stuck paying it off if you die.

Providing a tax-advantaged supplement to retirement savings. Buying cash value life insurance can provide a tax-deferred way to save for retirement, particularly if you’re already maxing out tax-deferred accounts, like a 401(k) and individual retirement account (IRA).

Leave a legacy. Choosing permanent life insurance can allow you to leave a guaranteed inheritance to your loved ones or make a substantial gift to charity.

Pay for estate taxes. With the federal estate tax exemption at $12.92 million in 2023, most people don’t need to worry about estate taxes. But some high-net-worth people use life insurance as an estate-planning tool to cover the tax bill.

Determining your coverage amount

There’s no one-size-fits all method to determine how much life insurance coverage is sufficient, but there are a few common formulas that can help you gauge your needs. Keep in mind that these are rough estimates. Consider working with a financial professional to determine the amount of life insurance coverage and the best life insurance policy type for your unique situation.

Multiple of income

Determine how many years you’d want to replace your income for, then multiply your salary by that number. If you earn $50,000 a year and want to replace your income for 20 years, you need a $1 million death benefit.

Younger people will usually want to choose a higher multiple than older individuals because they have more potential future earnings. Someone who’s 35 may want to replace 30 years of income, while replacing 10 years of income may suffice for a 60-year-old.

10 times your income plus college costs

In this formula, you multiply your income by 10, then add in the costs of higher education for your children. Many experts recommend estimating college costs at $100,000 to $150,000 per child.

DIME formula

With the DIME formula, you add up the following amounts to estimate how much life insurance you need:

Debt: Your total non-mortgage debt

Income: The amount of income you want to replace

Mortgage: The amount you need to pay off your mortgage in full

Education: The expected costs of your children’s education

Essentially, you’d use the multiple of income formula, then add in your total debt (including your mortgage payoff amount) and education costs to arrive at a benefit amount.

Pro tip: Even if no one relies on your income, you might still need life insurance. For example, stay-at-home parents of young children should consider buying a policy.

Life insurance process

The first step in the life insurance process is to decide what type of insurance you want, along with how much coverage you’re seeking. Then, you can obtain a quote online or through a life insurance agent. To get an accurate life insurance quote, you’ll usually need to provide some basic information like your date of birth, gender, height and weight, tobacco usage, and whether you take blood pressure or cholesterol medication.

Once you’ve chosen the policy you want, you’ll need to complete the application. The typical underwriting process involves a detailed health questionnaire and a medical exam. The insurer may also ask you to get what’s called an attending physician statement from your doctor if they need more context about any health issues.

After your application is approved, you’ll need to review the policy documents and sign the contract. Coverage will begin shortly after you make your first premium. To avoid a lapse in coverage, you’ll need to continue paying the premiums.

Pro tip: Some policies, known as guaranteed issue policies, approve nearly all applicants without requiring health information. But these policies have low death benefits, often $25,000 or less.

Conclusion: Do you need life insurance?

Not everyone needs life insurance. If you don’t have dependents and you have enough savings to pay for final expenses, you may not need coverage. However, if you hope to have a family someday, buying coverage while you’re young can help you lock in an affordable insurance rate.

To determine whether you need life insurance, consider whether anyone would be financially burdened if you die. If the answer is yes, life insurance is probably well worth the cost.

No one likes to think about dying. But it’s essential to take time to prepare for the worst to protect your loved ones’ well-being.","['Robin Hartill', 'Cfp', 'October', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Where’s my refund? How to check your federal tax refund status.,"If you’re antsy about when your federal income tax refund will hit your bank account, you’re not alone. For fiscal year 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimated about 120.9 million individual taxpayers were owed refunds, amounting to a whopping $461.2 billion. That’s a lot of spare change being left in Uncle Sam’s hands.

Want to know when you’ll get back what you overpaid in federal taxes? Of course you do. Read on.

How long does it usually take for the IRS to process a tax refund?

Although IRS.gov says most refunds are processed within 21 days of receiving a federal tax filing, there are a lot of variables that can affect refund processing times.

For instance, if you have an e-filed return and opt for direct deposit, your tax return will likely get processed quickly. However, if you file a paper return and claim the earned income tax credit (EITC), your individual income tax return could take longer to process.

To get a better handle on when to expect your tax refund, consult the charts provided by the CPA Practice Advisor here. According to its estimates, a complete and accurate e-file return received by Feb. 24, 2025, could see a direct deposit initiated from the IRS in as little as 10 days, or by March 7, 2025. A paper refund check would likely arrive a week later, around March 14, 2025.

How to check your tax refund status in 3 easy steps

The easiest way to figure out when your money might turn up is to check the status of your refund with the IRS. Here’s where to go and what additional information you might need to check your return status.

Step 1: Gather your refund information

You’re going to need a few pieces of information, including:

Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification number (ITIN)

Filing status (single, married, filing jointly, etc.)

Exact refund amount listed on your return

You’ll also be asked to identify which tax year you’d like to track refunds for. Whether it’s the prior year or several years back, make sure you have all your tax forms in order.

Step 2: Go to Where’s My Refund or the IRS2Go app

You can access your online account with the IRS by providing the information above either at Where’s My Refund or through the IRS2Go mobile app. Status tracking should be available within 24 hours after you e-file a tax return or up to four weeks after you send a paper return.

Step 3: Identify your tax return status

Here are the status updates you might receive as you track your federal tax return and what each means.

Return received

This status simply means the IRS has formally received your return. Sit tight and wait for more information.

Refund approved

Your return has been processed and a refund is pending. Once the funds are available and have been sent, your status will update.

Refund sent

Good news. Your refund has either been deposited directly to the account you specified or a paper check is in the mail. Keep in mind that once the IRS sends the funds, it could still take up to five business days for the transfer to post to your bank account.

If additional review is required or you need to submit an amended return, you’ll find further instructions included alongside your refund status in the IRS refund tracker.

Where’s my refund? 4 scenarios that might delay your tax refund

While there can be some bumps in the road that make tax season rough, there are easy ways to avoid a delayed refund. Here are common reasons tax pros say could delay your refund and what you can do about it.

1. Your tax return has errors or is incomplete

If you make a mistake or leave some information blank, the IRS may ask you to submit an amended return. Don’t panic. This doesn’t always mean you’ll be audited. It just means your return is pending and requires additional review.

2. You’re claiming the earned income credit or additional child tax credit

These tax credits may take longer to process because the IRS can not legally disperse these refunds until mid-February. If you claim these credits and submit a return early in the tax season, the IRS says you can expect a refund by early March.

3. You filed a paper return

If you’re still using snail mail to submit your federal tax return, it’s probably going to result in delays to your refund, which will be compounded if you opt for a paper check instead of direct deposit.

4. You’ve been a victim of identity theft or fraud

There’s a small chance that a delayed refund is a sign you've been a victim of identity theft or tax fraud. Consult the IRS identity theft guide for individual taxpayers to find out what next steps you should take.

Frequently asked questions

Can I expedite the processing of my federal tax return?

Unlike passports or the lines at Disneyland, there’s no fee you can pay or specific action you can take to speed up the processing of your tax return. However, if you review your return carefully, submit it electronically, and choose direct deposit, you can reduce friction in the process and minimize delays in receiving your refund.

Can I track my state income tax return?

While you can’t use the IRS tool to track your state tax return, many states offer similar trackers on their Department of Revenue websites, which you can find linked at the Federation of Tax Administrators. You’ll need similar information to track your state tax return, including your Social Security number, tax year, filing status, and the exact refund amount.

When should I call the IRS if my tax refund is late or missing?

There are a few signs it might be time to contact the IRS about a delayed tax refund. First and foremost, the Where’s My Refund tracker on the official website might instruct you to call the IRS. You should also call if it’s been more than 21 days since you e-filed or more than six weeks since you mailed a federal tax return.

3. VITA for low-income taxpayers

Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) provides free tax preparation to low- and moderate-income taxpayers. VITA places staff in libraries, schools, and other convenient sites around the country with IRS-certified volunteers who provide in-person, free tax help.

There are a few eligibility requirements, including income of $67,000 or less, having a disability, or being a limited English speaker in need of tax filing assistance. You can check for a VITA site near you using the IRS locator tool.

4. Tax Counseling for the Elderly

A sister program to VITA, Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) uses a federal grant to provide free tax preparation services to older taxpayers. Many TCE sites are run in cooperation with the nonprofit AARP Foundation Tax-Aide program.

Like other free tax filing options listed here, TCE programs are best suited to simple tax returns for those who receive a pension or have retirement-related concerns. While you typically need to be 60 or older to qualify for TCE services, some AARP sites offer tax help to low- to moderate-income filers aged 50 and up.

Free tax filing FAQs

1. How do I calculate my adjusted gross income?

Deciding which free tax filing option is best involves checking your adjusted gross income or taxable income. Fortunately, calculating your adjusted gross income for your income tax return is a fairly simple formula.

Total the income you’ll report, such as wages, dividends, and interest from savings accounts, then subtract any deductions, credits, or adjustments you’re eligible to take.

2. Do I still need to file a federal tax return if I paid estimated or self-employment taxes quarterly?

Yes. If you’re self-employed and pay estimated taxes quarterly, you still need to file a tax return with the IRS to ensure you’ve paid the right amount. Make a detailed reporting of all your sources of income from your W-2 forms, including anything you receive for services or products sold through platforms like PayPal or Venmo.

3. Do any states offer free e-file or free tax filing software?

Some states offer free tax filing assistance for both federal and state returns, usually tied to lower-income households via a partnership with a third-party tax preparation provider.

Check your state’s department of revenue website for details about any free tax prep programs you may qualify for.

4. Who qualifies for the IRS free federal filing?

The IRS free filing program is available for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less. It offers free federal tax preparation for low- to moderate-income taxpayers through IRS tax software partners, including some state filing and Spanish-speaking tax preparation assistance.

5. Is there a free way to e-file taxes?

If you’re above the income thresholds for the IRS Free File program, you may be able to use the Direct File program depending on what state you live in. The Direct File pilot program allows federal taxpayers to e-file taxes directly with the IRS but is only available in 25 states.

Some tax preparation providers are also authorized to e-file directly with the IRS. You can find a ZIP code database of these e-file providers here.

6. Which states can use IRS free tax filing for 2025?

Anyone with an adjusted gross income below the $84,000 threshold can take advantage of the IRS free filing program.

Above that income threshold, Direct File options are in 25 states for this filing season: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming.","['Kaz Weida', 'April', 'Min Read']"

Millions of taxpayers are granted extensions every year for all kinds of reasons, including that they just couldn’t get their paperwork together in time.

The good news is that getting an extension from the IRS is fairly easy. However, before you kick the tax can down the road, it’s critical you understand how tax extensions work, especially that a tax extension gives you more time to file but not more time to pay.

Read more: What if I can't pay my taxes?

What is a tax extension?

A tax extension is a request you file via an IRS form that extends the filing deadline for your tax return. Note that this extension applies to your tax paperwork, not your tax payment.

Put another way: Although a tax extension extends the due date for filing tax returns, it does not extend the payment deadline if you owe money to the IRS. While filing the appropriate tax forms for an extension means you’ll avoid a failure-to-file penalty, you’ll still incur a late payment penalty if you don’t pay your estimated tax bill by tax day.

How does a federal tax return extension work?

A federal tax return extension provides more time to file your tax return in a given tax year, usually six months. You can only file for one extension per tax return, so make the extra time count. If you don’t owe money to the IRS, you’re not required to file a tax return or request an extension.

Still, you should double-check because if you owe money, you’ll need to submit an estimated income tax payment along with your extension request. This is why tax extensions can help if you’re still gathering documents to file your taxes, but they are not a get-out-of-paying-taxes-until-later card.

Keep in mind that filing for a federal extension at IRS.gov also doesn’t provide an automatic extension on your state taxes. In some cases, you’ll need to file paperwork for a separate extension, typically a state tax extension, to avoid additional penalties for failing to file your state taxes by the deadline.

What is this year’s federal tax extension deadline?

The deadline to file an extension for the 2024 tax year is Tuesday, April 15, 2025 — the same as the federal filing deadline. Once you’ve filed for an extension, your deadline is extended six months to Oct. 15, 2025.

Certain taxpayers automatically get additional time to file a tax return without a late-filing penalty, including U.S. citizens living and working abroad, some military members and their families, and people affected by FEMA-declared natural disasters.

How to file an IRS tax extension: A step-by-step guide

Need a little extra time to get your tax documents in order? Follow these steps for filing an extension by April 15, 2025.

Step 1: Determine if you owe money or you’re owed a tax refund

You don’t need to know your total taxes down to the last dime, but you should calculate your adjusted gross income (AGI) and compare it to the taxes you’ve paid during the year to see if you’re likely to be issued a refund or owe money to the IRS.

The IRS has instructions about how to calculate your AGI, but you can also consult a tax pro or use tax software to double-check your numbers. Don’t forget to apply deductions and credits that could significantly reduce your taxable income.

If you’re owed a tax refund, it's still a good idea to file for an extension just in case you end up owing.

Think you’ll have tax due? Proceed to the next step.

Step 2: File an extension on your federal taxes

There are a few ways to file an extension. You can electronically request an extension online with IRS form 4868 (Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return), or you can fill out and mail the paper form.

The form is available on the IRS website or through the IRS Free File, an e-file tax software for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of $79,000 or less. You can also consult with a tax professional or use tax software like H&R Block to access tax extension information and forms.

While federal tax extensions are almost always granted, you should check back to verify the status of your request. If you need to correct your request because of misspellings or other mistakes, the IRS usually provides several business days to do so.

Step 3: File a state extension if needed

Chances are if you owe federal taxes, you might also owe taxes to the state where you reside or work. This can be a significant concern for filers who are self-employed contractors or sole proprietors of business entities that aren’t required to pay quarterly estimated state taxes.

Like a federal tax filing extension, a state extension will give you more time to prepare your tax return but doesn’t extend the deadline for paying your taxes.

Step 4: Figure out a payment plan

To avoid being charged interest or late payment penalties, you should pay as much of your tax bill as you can by the deadline. But if you’re worried you can’t cover your unpaid taxes, don’t panic — you’ve got options.

If your balance due with the IRS is $50,000 or less, you can request to make payments in monthly installments with a long-term repayment plan. For those with outsized balances between $50,000 and $100,000, the IRS offers a short-term repayment plan of 180 days or less.

Most states also offer similar payment options to struggling taxpayers. For instance, California gives qualified taxpayers who owe $25,000 or less anywhere from three- to five-year payment plans to pay off in installments.

Tax extension FAQs

1. Is there a penalty for filing an income tax extension?

There’s no penalty for requesting an extension on filing your federal income tax return. In fact you’ll avoid a failure-to-file penalty if you submit an extension request by the tax deadline.

However, there is a failure-to-pay penalty if you don’t pay your taxes on time. The penalty can be anywhere from 0.5% of the amount you owe each month up to a maximum of 25% of your total unpaid balance.

2. Can you file a tax extension request online?

Yes, you can submit a federal tax extension request online, either through IRS Free File, free e-file form or fillable versions of Form 4868, or if you’re paying electronically on the IRS website. There are also ways to file for a federal tax extension through free or paid versions of tax software or with tax preparation assistance from a tax professional.

3. Does a tax extension give me more time to pay my tax bill?

No. The bottom line is getting a federal tax extension gives you more time to gather your tax documents and file your tax return. But no matter your tax situation, an extension does not give you more time to pay your taxes.

However, if you can’t afford to pay the full balance of what you owe the IRS now, you can leverage both long-term and short-term payment plans to break your tax bill into more manageable monthly installments and avoid penalties.","['Kaz Weida', 'April', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Child tax credit: Everything you need to know to claim it,"The child tax credit is a tax break that applies a credit to your income taxes for a qualifying child or children, potentially earning you a refund on your federal tax return.

The value of the credit has fluctuated in recent years. We’ll cover the maximum the credit is worth for the 2024 and 2025 tax years, the criteria for qualifying, plus other tax credits provided through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that can assist moderate or low-income families.

What is the child tax credit?

The child tax credit is a partially refundable tax credit that can reduce qualifying families’ federal income tax liability to zero. Because it’s nonrefundable, it cannot generate a refund. But it’s dollar-for-dollar, meaning the amount you get in credits is the amount subtracted from your tax bill.

The child tax credit generally applies to dependent children under 17, although there are some other criteria set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that taxpayers must meet, including an income limit. If your gross income exceeds the income threshold, you may still be eligible to receive partial credit for qualifying children.

Read more: Here are 7 free tax filing options

What’s the additional child tax credit?

The additional child tax credit is a refundable portion of the child tax credit available to eligible families who owe taxes that add up to less than the child credit. There are both dependent status and income criteria to qualify for the portion of the child tax credit that’s fully refundable.

Whether you have a dependent child or not, it helps to understand how a refundable credit works. Refundable tax credits lower tax liability past zero, potentially triggering a refund on a federal tax return for eligible taxpayers.

For example, if you owe $2,500 but qualify for a refundable credit of $3,000, the IRS would owe you $500. If the credit were instead nonrefundable, your tax bill would go down to zero but wouldn’t trigger a tax refund. Another example of this type of refundable tax credit is the earned income tax credit (EITC).

Read more: What is the earned income tax credit, and how does it work?

How much is the child tax credit for 2024 and 2025?

Let’s get down to dollar amounts. The maximum amount for each qualifying child is $2,000 with the refundable portion totaling $1,600 per qualifying child.

Whether you’ll receive the full amount of the credit depends on your modified adjusted gross income and your filing status. The income thresholds for different filers are:

$400,000 for married filing jointly

$200,000 for single, head of household, married filing separately, and qualified widow(er) with dependent

If your income exceeds the threshold, your full credit will be reduced by $50 for each $1,000 you earned in the tax year that puts you over the limit.

Who qualifies for the child tax credit?

The following are the criteria the IRS uses to determine eligibility to claim the child tax credit.

Age and status of dependent

The child you are claiming as a dependent must be under 17 by the end of the tax year for which you are filing. They must also not have filed a joint tax return unless they are trying to recover estimated taxes paid or withheld income taxes.

Relationship and support

The qualifying child must be your son or daughter, stepchild, foster child, brother or sister, step-sibling, grandchild, nephew or niece. They must have lived with you for more than half of the tax year and provided no more than half of their own financial support during that time.

Citizenship status

Last but not least, the child you are seeking to claim as a dependent must have a valid Social Security number that makes them eligible for employment and qualifies them as a U.S. citizen or a U.S. national.

Child tax credit after 2025

President Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' increased the child tax credit by $200 beginning in 2026 and beyond, to a maximum of $2,200 per child. The refundable portion of the child tax credit, aka the additional child tax credit, can be worth up to $1,700.

What’s the difference between the child tax credit and the child and dependent care credit?

Although the child tax credit and the child and dependent care credit sound similar, they are different tax credits. The IRS designed the dependent care tax credit for care expenses for young children (under 13) of working parents and caregivers with incapacitated spouses or loved ones.

This credit can provide a maximum refund of $3,000 to $6,000 on qualified expenses depending on your filing status and income, so it’s worth checking to see if you and your dependent meet the criteria.

You can find the IRS guide to child and dependent care expenses here.

3 steps to claiming the child tax credit

Once you’ve determined you meet the criteria, the process for claiming a child tax credit with the IRS is fairly easy, provided you submit your tax return by the deadline.

1. List children and other dependents on your Form 1040

There’s a portion of the 1040, the US individual income tax return form, where you’re asked to list your children and other qualifying dependents. If you’re using tax software or the IRS free tax filing tool, you’ll enter this information through a series of questions.

2. Complete Schedule 8812

This IRS worksheet helps you correctly calculate your child tax credits. Still, you’ll need info from the 1040 form to complete the schedule, arrive at a specific dollar amount, and determine if you’re eligible for the additional child tax credit.

3. Follow up if your CTC claim was denied

If you file early, note that the IRS doesn’t release the child tax credit refund until mid-February. However, if you qualify, you should see the refund hit your account via direct deposit as early as Feb. 27.

Denied? You can follow up with the IRS to determine why. If you need to correct your claim, you may be asked to fill out a Schedule 8862, which also applies to the earned income credit, before you resubmit.

Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

1. Can two parents claim the same child for the child tax credit?

A qualified child can only be claimed on one tax return, which means if parents file separately, they can’t both claim the same dependent.

What happens if both parents try to claim the same child? Turbo Tax says the IRS generally treats this as a first-come, first-serve situation and will deny the second claim they receive and request that the parent resubmit their tax return.

2. Is there a state child tax credit?

Twelve states provide a fully refundable state child tax credit: California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Vermont). Four more states — Arizona, Idaho, Oklahoma, and Utah — have a nonrefundable credit.

The amounts and eligibility requirements of the credits vary.

3. What’s the expanded child tax credit?

The expanded child tax credit was part of The American Rescue Plan and gave an income boost to eligible parents during the pandemic, raising the child tax credit amount significantly and issuing direct monthly payments to eligible families.

This approach is credited with reducing child poverty in America, but the advanced payments and higher credit amounts in the expanded child tax credit expired in 2021.","['Kaz Weida', 'July', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Federal or private student loans? Here’s what the difference is.,"Earning a college degree can significantly enhance your career, but it's not cheap — many students take on loans to pay for their education. According to the College Board, 50% of bachelor's degree recipients graduated with student loan debt.

If you need to finance your degree, it's essential to understand the two primary types of student loans: federal and private. Which type you use will affect your borrowing limits, repayment options, and overall loan cost.

Are federal or private loans better? In general, experts recommend exhausting federal loan options before turning to private loans. Although the Trump administration has made changes to federal financial aid, the recommendation to use federal loans first remains the same. However, for some borrowers, private student loans may be a more cost-effective option.

What are federal student loans?

Federal student loans are offered by the U.S. Department of Education, and they make up the vast majority of outstanding education debt. In fact, federal loans account for more than 90% of the $1.77 trillion in national student loan debt.

Financial experts and organizations, such as the National Association of Financial Aid Administrators, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and The Institute for College Access & Success, all stress the importance of exhausting all federal financial aid — including federal student loans — before turning to private loans. Why? They usually have lower interest rates than private loans, and the government provides more borrower protections and repayment options than private lenders.

For students and their parents, there are three different types of student loans available from the federal government:

Direct Subsidized: These loans are available only to undergraduate students who demonstrate significant financial need. The government waives the interest that accrues while the student is in school, during the loan’s grace period, and during any periods of deferment.

Direct Unsubsidized: Direct Unsubsidized loans can be used for undergraduate or graduate programs, though loans used for graduate school come with higher rates. The student is responsible for all interest that accrues.

Parent PLUS: Parents can borrow money to pay for their biological or adopted child's undergraduate education.

All federal loans have fixed interest rates, and all borrowers — regardless of their credit or income — qualify for the same rate on a given loan type.

Important: Grad PLUS Loans are a type of federal loan for professional and graduate students. However, the 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) eliminated this loan program. As of July 1, 2026, they will no longer be available.

What is a private student loan?

Private student loans make up a small part — about 8% — of the overall student loan market. While the federal government issues federal loans, private student loans are provided by banks, credit unions, online lenders, and other financial institutions.

Although federal loans have fixed interest rates, private student loans can have either fixed or variable interest rates. Variable-rate loans typically have lower initial rates than fixed-rate loans, but the rates can change over time. Repayment terms on private education debt typically range from five to 15 years.

Students can use private student loans to pay for undergraduate or graduate programs. However, private loans are credit-based, meaning lenders have strict borrower requirements, and not everyone will qualify for a loan. Young college students typically don’t have the required credit to borrow yet, so parents or other loved ones often co-sign these loans.

Stuck with private student loans with high interest rates? Refinancing your private student loans could mean lower monthly payments and paying less interest overall.

6 key differences between federal and private loans

When considering which type of student loans to use, consider these essential differences:

1. Annual and lifetime borrowing limits

Annual and lifetime borrowing limits differ significantly between federal and private student loans, with private loans offering higher maximums.

There are established caps on Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized student loans. Depending on your dependency status and the year of college you're entering, the annual maximum ranges from $3,500 to $12,500 for undergraduate students and up to $20,500 for graduate students.

An aggregate or lifetime maximum also applies. It ranges from $31,000 to $57,500 for undergraduate students, and $138,500 for graduate students (that number includes all federal student loans you used for undergraduate study, too).

For Grad PLUS and Parent PLUS Loans, borrowers can borrow up to the total cost of attendance, as certified by the school.

However, the OBBB instituted new limits for loans issued on or after July 1, 2026. These limits will significantly impact graduate and professional students and parent borrowers. The table below highlights the new limits that will apply in the 2026-27 school year:

With private loans, lenders rarely have a fixed maximum. Instead, they allow students and parents to borrow up to the total cost of attendance for their program. Because their lending maximums aren't as restrictive as federal loans, private loans are a useful option for borrowers who have reached the federal borrowing limits and need additional cash to pay for school.

2. Credit and income criteria

Federal loans are generally easier to qualify for than private loans. Federal student loans have no minimum income requirements, and Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized don't involve credit checks at all.

Applicants for federal PLUS Loans will undergo a credit check, but the credit requirements are less intensive. Rather than looking for a specific FICO score or better, the government reviews your credit report to see if you have an “adverse” credit history, meaning recent major credit issues like foreclosure, vehicle repossession, or collections.

Requirements for private loans are stricter. Borrowers typically need to have established credit histories and a FICO score of 670 or higher, as well as meet minimum income requirements. If an applicant doesn't meet the lender's requirements, the only way to qualify for a private loan is to add a co-signer to their application.

3. Interest rates and fees

Federal loans always have fixed interest rates, and the rates for undergraduate loans tend to be low. They also have disbursement fees deducted from the loan when it is issued to you. These are the rates and fees for federal loans issued between July 1, 2025, and June 30, 2026:

Private loans can have fixed or variable interest rates, and they rarely have origination or disbursement fees. Rates vary by lender and whether the loan is used for undergraduate or graduate programs. We researched 20 leading private student loan lenders for undergraduate loans. As of August 2025, rates for variable-rate loans ranged from 4.19% to 18%, while fixed-rate loans ranged from 2.89% to 18%. Out of the 20 lenders we evaluated, none charged disbursement fees.

Important: Grad and Parent PLUS Loans have significantly higher rates than other federal loans. Borrowers with excellent credit may qualify for private student loans with lower rates, but keep in mind that private loans lack some of the benefits and protections of federal loans.

4. In-school payment plans

Federal student loans tend to be more generous in terms of in-school repayment than private lenders. Federal borrowers do not have to make payments while they're in school or during their grace period, a period of six months after they graduate or leave college. Even though payments aren’t required, most federal student loans do accrue interest while you’re in school.

With private student loans, you might have to make payments while you're in college. Private lenders typically have several in-school repayment options. Depending on the lender, you may be able to choose from the following plans:

Immediate: As soon as the loan is disbursed, you begin making full principal and interest payments each month.

Interest-only: After the loan is issued, you make monthly payments to cover the accrued interest while you're in school. Once you graduate, the payments increase, so you also pay toward the principal.

Fixed: With a fixed payment plan, you pay a specific amount, such as $25 per month, while in college. Once you graduate, the payments increase to cover the principal and interest.

Deferred: If you opt for deferred repayment, you don't have to make any payments until after you graduate. Because interest accrues during your time in school, the deferred payment plan has the highest overall repayment cost.

5. Repayment and hardship options after graduation

Where federal student loans really stand out is in borrower protection. Depending on your situation, you may qualify for the following options:

If you're sick or unemployed: If you become seriously ill or lose your job, you may be eligible for a federal deferment program. With these programs, you can postpone your payments for several months at a time.

If you return to school: If you decide to return to school to earn another degree, you can defer your federal student loan payments until after you graduate from the new program or leave school.

If your payment is too high: If you cannot afford the monthly payments under a standard 10-year repayment plan, you may be eligible for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. The payments are based on a percentage of your discretionary income, and some borrowers qualify for payments as low as $0.

However, the OBBB made changes to borrower protections. As of July 1, 2027, unemployment and financial hardship deferment programs won't be available. For borrowers who take out new loans on or after July 1, 2026, the current IDR plans will not be available; you'll only be able to choose from the new standard repayment plan and the new Repayment Assistance Plan.

6. Loan forgiveness eligibility

Federal student loans are often eligible for loan forgiveness programs. For example:

Public Service Loan Forgiveness : Borrowers may qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and get up to 100% of their outstanding loans forgiven after meeting the program's eligibility requirements. They must work for an eligible nonprofit organization or government office full-time for at least 10 years and make 120 qualifying monthly payments.

Teacher Loan Forgiveness: Teachers who teach high-need subjects in low-income schools or education service agencies for at least five years can qualify for up to $17,500 of loan forgiveness.

Private student loans aren't eligible for federal loan forgiveness programs like PSLF or Teacher Loan Forgiveness. But they may qualify for state-based loan repayment programs based on your employment, or for employer repayment assistance.

Are federal or private loans better?

Although the OBBB made major changes to the federal student loan program, federal loans are still a good starting point for most students. Particularly for undergraduate students without established credit histories, federal loans give you a relatively low-interest way to pay for your education.

However, private student loans may have a role in completing your degree if you reach the federal annual or aggregate borrowing limits (or if you don't qualify for federal student loans). Taking out a private loan could allow you to complete your program and earn a degree you otherwise wouldn't be able to finish.

Few families have enough money saved to cover that cost, which is why so many students end up taking out student loans. In fact, four in 10 families borrowed money to pay for college for the 2021-22 academic year.

If you have to borrow money, federal student loans are an excellent starting point due to their relatively low rates and borrower protections. Continue reading to learn about the different types of student loans available and how to apply for federal student loans.

What are federal student loans?

Federal student loans are the most common type of student loan. Nearly 93% of outstanding student loans are federal loans, with private student loans making up just 7% of the market.

The U.S. Department of Education is the lender behind federal loans, and it's the largest provider of education loans in the country. Currently, federal loans are issued under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loans).

With most federal loans, you don't have to make payments while you're in school, and they usually have grace periods. The grace period lasts for six months after you graduate or drop below half-time status; payments aren't required during this time, so it gives you a chance to get a job and start earning money before payments are due.

Types of student loans issued by the federal government

Within the federal Direct Loan program, there are four different types of student loans:

Direct Subsidized: Direct Subsidized loans are a type of loan designed specifically for undergraduate students that need substantial financial assistance. These are one of the most beneficial types of loans since the government waives the interest that accrues on the loan while you're in school, during the loan grace period and any periods of deferment.

Direct Unsubsidized: Direct Unsubsidized loans are for undergraduate and graduate students. Unlike Subsidized Loans, the borrower is responsible for all interest that accrues.

Direct PLUS: PLUS Loans are split into two categories: Grad PLUS: Grad PLUS loans are for graduate and professional students. Parent PLUS: Parent PLUS loans are for parents who want to borrow money to help a dependent child pay for their undergraduate education. The loans are solely in the parent borrower's name.

Direct Consolidation: Direct Consolidation loans are typically used after a student has graduated and their loans have entered repayment. It allows borrowers to combine their federal loans into one, simplifying their payments and potentially giving the borrower access to other payment plans.

Federal loan borrowing limits, rates, and fees

The federal government sets strict limits on how much students can borrow with most federal loans, and the maximum allowed is based on your year in school and whether you qualify as a dependent or independent student. Most undergraduate students, with rare exceptions, are classified as dependent students for financial aid purposes.

Loan rates and fees vary by loan type. Federal loan interest rates are set by Congress and they're fixed, so the rates stay the same for your entire loan term. Federal student loans also have disbursement fees, which are deducted from the loan amount when it's issued.

Below are the borrowing limits, rates, and fees for the different types of student loans:

Benefits of federal student loans

Federal student loans are the first choice for most students that need help paying for college for the following reasons:

There is no minimum credit score or income requirement

For students from low-income households or those with no credit histories, federal student loans provide financing they couldn't otherwise get from other sources.

Unlike other types of loans, federal loans have no minimum income requirement. Nor do they require a certain credit score. For Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans, there is no credit check at all.

For PLUS Loans, there is a credit check, but the U.S. Department of Education is only looking to see if you have an adverse credit history — recent serious credit issues like foreclosure or repossession — rather than a specific credit score.

You don't have to make payments while you're in school

With federal student loans, students don't have to make payments while they're in school or for six months after they graduate or leave college. Without payments due, you can focus on your education and get yourself financially secure before you have to worry about your monthly payments.

Federal PLUS loans do require payments while in school, but borrowers have the option of deferring payments until after graduation.

There are multiple repayment plans available

Federal student loans have a default 10-year repayment plan. But if you can't afford your payments, federal loans are eligible for other plans.

By enrolling in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, you can significantly reduce your payments. IDR plans determine your payments using a percentage of your discretionary income. Depending on how much you make and your family size, you could qualify for a payment as low as $0.

Plus, if you have a loan balance at the end of the IDR term, the government will forgive the remaining account balance.

Federal borrowers may qualify for loan forgiveness

One of the major perks of federal student loans is that they are eligible for loan forgiveness programs. The best known program is Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Under PSLF, nonprofit workers and employees of government agencies that work full-time for at least 10 years and make 120 qualifying monthly payments are eligible for forgiveness of 100% of their outstanding federal loans.

The interest rates are fixed

Federal student loans have fixed rates that stay the same for the entirety of your repayment term. That's quite different from some private student loans that have variable rates that change over time.

Depending on the economy and market conditions, the rates on variable-rate loans can start low, but dramatically increase. We found that variable-rate student loans can have rates as high as 18%.

How to apply for federal student loans

To apply for federal student loans (and other financial aid, including grants), you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA is a form that asks questions about your household income, family size, and assets to determine your financial need. It's what colleges use to create your financial aid package, which may include federal student loans. You can complete the FAFSA online at FAFSA.gov.

The federal FAFSA deadline is June 30, but states and schools may have different deadlines. You can see what deadlines apply at studentaid.gov.

Important: Many families don't fill out the FAFSA because they think they make too much money. However, there's no income maximum for the FAFSA. Even if you don't qualify for grants, you may be eligible for federal student loans, so it's worth taking the time to fill it out.

FAQs

Who is eligible for federal student loans?

To qualify for federal student loans, you must meet the following criteria:

You must be a US citizen or qualifying permanent resident.

You must have a valid Social Security number (Students from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia or the Republic of Palau are exempt from this requirement).

You must have earned a high school diploma, General Educational Development (GED) or an approved homeschooled equivalent.

Are undocumented or DACA students eligible for federal student loans?

Undocumented students, including those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, aren't eligible for federal student loans. To complete the FAFSA and apply for federal loans, you must have a valid Social Security number; undocumented and DACA students do not meet that requirement.

However, undocumented students may be eligible for other financial aid, including grants and scholarships issued by their state of residence, nonprofit organizations, and private companies.

Paying for college

Now that you know about the types of student loans available and how to apply for federal student loans, you can come up with a plan to pay for college. Most families will need to borrow some money to cover education costs, and federal student loans provide a lower-interest way to finance a degree.

To get all the financial aid you're entitled to, make sure you fill out the FAFSA by the federal, state and school deadlines. If you aren't sure when it's due, reach out to your college's financial aid office.","['Kat Tretina', 'December', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Your complete guide to FAFSA for the 2026-27 school year,"If you or your child is applying to college, there’s one abbreviation you need to know: FAFSA — Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The FAFSA can unlock financial aid to help cover the cost of college. In this guide, learn what the FAFSA is, the role it plays in receiving financial support, and what you need to know before applying.

What is FAFSA?

The FAFSA assesses your eligibility for federal grants, student loans, and work-study. These funding options can make education costs more manageable and reduce the financial burden on students and families.

To qualify for an award package from your school of choice, you must submit the FAFSA application by the federal deadline of June 30. However, there are both college and state deadlines for applicants to be aware of as well. Check the deadlines for your state on the Federal Student Aid site.

The fastest way to complete the FAFSA is through an online application. You can also print out the application and submit it via mail, but that can take longer to be processed.

For the 2026-27 academic year, expect the Department of Education to launch the FAFSA on Oct. 1, 2025. It's recommended that you submit the FAFSA as soon as possible, as some types of aid are first come, first served.

Understanding the basics of FAFSA

Students are required to fill out the FAFSA to access any federal financial aid options, as well as some state- and school-based financial aid.

In 2024, the federal government provided $120.8 billion in grants, loans, and work-study funds to more than 9.9 million students, according to the Education Department's Fiscal Year 2024 Annual Report.

Students must submit an application every year, and dependent students will need their parents' signature along with key parental information to complete the FAFSA.

The Student Aid page provides guidance on determining which parent to include and addresses situations involving divorced or widowed parents, adoption, or stepparents. If special circumstances prevent you from providing legal parent information, you can indicate this directly on the application.

Colleges review your FAFSA to assess your need level and eligibility for federal financial aid. They use this information to create a FAFSA Submission Summary, which outlines qualifying aid types, including federal loans, grants, and work-study programs.

Colleges also use the data to determine your eligibility for scholarships or school-based aid. The aid you receive varies by college based on their specific formula (more on that later).

Skipping the FAFSA application makes you ineligible for federal aid. While you could rely on family support or choose private loans, the FAFSA may provide free assistance options like grants and fixed-rate loans with strong protections.

Students who take out federal student loans can choose to repay loans under an income-driven repayment plan (IDR), which reduces monthly payments based on your earnings. Additionally, there are opportunities for student loan forgiveness, deferment, forbearance, and death discharge.

Who can apply for FAFSA?

Through the FAFSA, students can secure funding options to pay for higher education costs, provided by the federal government. Undergraduates, parents of undergrads, and graduate or professional students should all complete the FAFSA if they'd like to be considered for financial aid.

To qualify, students must meet certain eligibility requirements:

Have US citizenship or eligible noncitizen status

Have a valid Social Security number

Possess a high school diploma or GED, or complete a valid homeschooling or eligible career program

Be accepted or currently attending a qualifying degree or certificate program

Maintain a minimum of half-time enrollment

Meet the school’s standards for academic achievements

Sign a statement confirming you’ll use funds toward education, are not currently in default, or do not owe money on a grant

If you meet and maintain the above requirements, you can apply for FAFSA and obtain federal financial aid.

What info do you need for the FAFSA application?

As part of filling out the FAFSA application, you’ll be asked to provide some personal and financial information. You’ll need to provide:

Full name

Current address

Date of birth

Social Security number

Contact information

Alien registration number, if applicable

Information about total assets

Untaxed income

Tax data

Whether you’re a dependent or independent student

Household size

Number of household members in college

If you're a dependent student, as most undergraduates are, your parent will also need to provide similar info about themselves.

StudentAid.gov

How to complete the FAFSA

You can fill out the FAFSA online at FAFSA.gov or submit a paper version via mail. It’s recommended that you complete the application online, as it offers faster processing and access to the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. Here are the steps required to complete the FAFSA.

Step 1: Create an FSA ID

If it's your first time submitting the FAFSA, create an FSA ID. This allows applicants to sign the FAFSA electronically, sign your Master Promissory Note (MPN) for loans, and take part in loan counseling.

You’ll be required to provide your Social Security number and email address to create an account. Dependent students should also have a parent create a separate FSA ID for themselves.

Step 2: Compile information and documents

Use the list above to gather all the information and documents you need to fill out the FAFSA. Have your tax returns and current asset balances handy. Depending on your situation, you may need information from your parents or spouse as well.

Step 3: Fill out the FAFSA

Next, complete the application.

You can expect the process to take roughly half an hour. By submitting your application online, you may qualify to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. This tool helps you easily access your tax data and import it into the FAFSA.

In addition, you’ll be asked to list the colleges where you’d like to send your FAFSA application. Award packages vary by school. You must list a minimum of one school and up to 20 for online applications. If you want to add more, you can do so later.

Currently, the FAFSA has a little less than 50 questions, though some have multiple steps.

Step 4: Submit the FAFSA

After completing the FAFSA, review everything and then get ready to submit. Before doing so, you’ll need to sign the application (in addition to a parent, if applicable). The easiest way is to use your FSA ID, which allows you to do this electronically.

By submitting online, you can ensure fast processing, which typically takes between one and three days. If you submit it via mail, it can take seven to 10 days.

Step 5: Review status

You can keep tabs on your FAFSA status. After a few days, go to FASFA.gov and use your FSA ID to log in. If you see “Processed,” you’re good to go.

If it’s “In Progress,” you can check back later. You might also see “Action Required."" If you need to take further action, contact the school to see about next steps.

Step 6: Check your FAFSA Submission Summary

You’ll receive a FAFSA Submission Summary within a few days. The summary outlines the information you provided in the FAFSA. Double-check that everything is correct. If there are any errors, make corrections ASAP.

You can do so by logging into your account on FASFA.gov with your FSA ID. From there, go to “My FAFSA” and then “Make Corrections.” Correct the errors and submit again.

Your FAFSA Submission Summary will show:

Student Aid Index, which is an index number used by schools to calculate what aid you are eligible for

If further verification is required

It’s important to note that the amounts in your FAFSA Submission Summary are estimates and may differ from your final award package from your school. The schools you included in the FAFSA will be able to access your FAFSA Submission Summary and determine your eligibility for federal financial aid. Most schools will send a formal aid offer only after they accept the student for admission.

FAFSA mistakes to avoid

Though the FAFSA asks many questions and may take some time, qualifying for federal financial aid is worth the effort. But making a mistake when applying can delay the process. Here are some top FAFSA mistakes to avoid.

Not creating an FSA ID for you and your parents: An FSA ID can help expedite the process and allow you to sign your online application. Dependent students must have a parent create a separate FSA ID as well.

Entering the wrong identification information: When you start the FAFSA, you’ll be asked if you're the student, parent, or preparer. Make sure to select the correct option to have some of your data entered into the application and avoid potential trouble.

Missing important deadlines: The FAFSA can get tricky, as there are three deadlines you need to be aware of — federal, state, and college deadlines.

Not including all the schools you’re interested in: Schools play a major role in the aid you receive, so list all the schools you’re applying to.

Skipping the IRS Data Retrieval Tool: The DRT helps you avoid the hassle of inputting information and can do the heavy lifting for you. If you're eligible, use the DRT to streamline the process and avoid typos.

FAFSA factors and formulas

When calculating your eligibility for federal aid, the factors that are considered include:

Cost of attendance (COA) for the particular school, which includes total estimated costs for the year

Student Aid Index (SAI), which considers your family's financial resources and minimum living expenses to determine how much funding could potentially go toward college costs

Need-based aid uses the following formula:

Cost of attendance – Expected family contribution = Financial need

If you qualify for need-based aid, you may be eligible for a federal Pell Grant, federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Direct Subsidized Loan, or federal Work-Study.

If you receive grants, you typically don’t have to pay them back like you do with loans. Direct Subsidized Loans must be repaid, but come with one major perk: The government covers the interest while you’re in school as well as during your grace period after graduation.

Work-study provides students with the opportunity to work part-time while in school. These jobs can be on or off campus and provide income to help pay for expenses.

Non-need-based aid uses the following formula:

Cost of attendance – Financial aid awarded = Eligibility for non-need-based aid

Based on this formula, you can qualify for Direct Unsubsidized Loans, federal PLUS Loans, and Teacher Education Access for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants.

Direct Unsubsidized Loans require repayment and accrue interest immediately. PLUS loans are offered to graduate students or parents. TEACH grants are unique in that they require a service obligation, where you must work a minimum number of years at an eligible school. If that requirement isn’t met, the grant becomes a loan the recipient must pay back.

What are special circumstances for FAFSA?

As part of the FAFSA, you’re asked about your financial situation. The application uses prior-prior year (PPY) for income verification. In other words, for the 2026-2027 application, tax returns from 2024 are used (i.e., two years before).

A lot can happen in that time, and your or your family's current financial situation may be vastly different. For example, if you’ve been laid off or experienced a reduction in income, you may be eligible to have your financial aid adjusted. In that case, once your FAFSA is submitted, reach out to the financial aid office at the school you plan to attend to discuss the changes in your financial situation.

Other situations may make you eligible for a financial aid adjustment; this isn’t guaranteed, but it’s worth contacting the financial aid office. Such events include:

Parental death or divorce

Homelessness

Refugee status

Parental abuse or abandonment

Some of these situations may also allow for a dependency override. In other words, it allows financial aid administrators to change your dependency status based on ""unusual circumstances.""

You’ll need to submit an appeal letter and include any supporting documents. Discuss this option with a financial aid administrator to see about updating your award package.

The FAFSA isn’t a one-time thing; it must be renewed each school year by the appropriate deadlines. The good news is that most of your information is transferred over from the previous year. However, it’s your job to make any updates if there have been changes, such as a loss of income.

You can renew your FAFSA by logging into your Student Aid account using your FSA ID. Under “My FAFSA,” you can find “Renew my FAFSA form.” From there, you can make the appropriate updates, sign, and submit.

If you miss the FAFSA submission or renewal deadlines, it could impact the aid you receive. It may even make you ineligible for any aid. If your school allows for a late filing and some aid, the amount may be lower than expected.

When is FAFSA due?

One of the most important questions is, “When is FAFSA due?” The answer isn’t as straightforward, as there are three deadlines to be aware of for FAFSA:

Federal deadline College deadline State deadline

The FAFSA application is typically available every year starting Oct. 1, and the federal submission deadline is June 30. FAFSA launched Oct. 1, 2024, for the 2025-2026 school year.

For the 2025-2026 school year, you must submit the application by June 30, 2026. For the 2026-2027 school year, you must submit the application no later than June 30, 2027.

College deadlines can vary, so check with your school(s) of choice for deadlines. You can review state deadlines — some states have deadlines listed, while others require you to contact the financial aid office.

Filling out the application shortly after it’s available to ensure you qualify for financial aid is ideal. If you miss the deadline, you could jeopardize your award options.

FAFSA FAQs

What if FAFSA doesn’t cover everything?

If you’ve filled out the FAFSA and your award package doesn’t cover all your costs, you have a few options. Start by contacting your school's financial aid office to see if there’s additional aid available. Look into other scholarships and grants as well as work opportunities. Additionally, if all other options still aren't enough, you can look into private student loans.

How much is too much income for FAFSA?

Income is one of many factors used to determine financial aid and must be reported in the FAFSA. If you think you or your family earn too much, it’s important to be aware that there isn’t an income cap for aid. You may not receive need-based aid, but you could still qualify for federal student loans.

Who can help me with the FAFSA?

If you need extra support to complete the FAFSA, you can reach out to the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC). You can call 800-433-3243, send an email, or use the Live Chat function.

When is the FAFSA deadline for the 2025-26 school year?

The FAFSA federal deadline is June 30, 2026. However, you may have different FAFSA deadlines for both your state and college. Be sure to review all three deadlines to make sure you submit your application on time.","['Melanie Lockert', 'Ben Luthi', 'September', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Worried about when student loan repayments resume? These programs could help.,"Borrowers with federal student loans haven't had to make payments or worry about accrued interest since March 2020. On top of that, millions of Americans thought their student loans would be eliminated through President Joe Biden's one-time student loan forgiveness program.

However, the Supreme Court struck down Biden's plan, ending the hopes of student loan debt relief for many. Congress also passed a law preventing any federal loan payment freeze extensions, so the payment pause will end in October.

The Biden administration acted quickly and announced new measures that could help borrowers struggling with their payments. Taking advantage of these programs could help you reduce your payments, get your loans in good standing, and avoid student loan default.

News for borrowers with federal student loans

When do student loans resume? It's a common question, and the answer has changed several times. Initially, the loan payment freeze on federal student loans was planned to last for only a few months. But then-President Trump — and later, President Biden — repeatedly extended the freeze. As a result, many borrowers haven't made payments toward their federal loans in over three years.

Now, payments are set to resume. According to the US Department of Education, interest will start to accrue on Sept. 1, 2023, and payments will begin in October 2023.

To make student loan repayment more manageable, the Biden administration launched three key initiatives:

12-month on-ramp to repayment for federal student loans

Typically, borrowers who fail to make on-time payments face steep consequences, including:

The negative activity is reported to the credit bureaus and noted on your credit history.

The account can be sent to collections.

If the loan enters default, the government can garnish your wages.

However, the government created a temporary ""on-ramp"" period. It gives borrowers 12 months to come up with a plan for managing their loans without worrying about missed or partial payments being reported to the credit bureaus or sent to collections agencies or the loans entering default.

Student loan interest will continue to accrue during this time, so paying the minimum required — or as much as you can afford — will help you avoid added interest charges. But the on-ramp period gives you time to adjust to student loan payments resuming without the severe consequences that usually come with late or missed payments.

Fresh Start program for borrowers in default

The Fresh Start program is a new initiative from the Biden administration for borrowers with student loan debt who were in default before the March 13, 2020, payment freeze. Under this program, the government is eliminating the negative impact of student loan default for those borrowers, allowing them to enter repayment like other borrowers so they can start their repayment with a fresh slate.

The Fresh Start program will last for one year after the end of the federal payment freeze, and it provides borrowers with the following benefits:

Restores access to income-driven repayment (IDR) plans

Reestablishes eligibility to federal student aid programs like Pell Grants

Protects borrowers from collections activity and negative credit reporting

Gives borrowers the option of qualifying for student loan rehabilitation if they default later on

The program is not automatic; to take advantage of the Fresh Start initiative, borrowers must take the following steps:

Reach out to the loan holder: Borrowers must contact their loan holder and state that they want to take advantage of the program. You can start by visiting myeddebt.ed.gov or calling 1-800-621-3115.

The government removes your default status: After making arrangements, your loans will be transferred to a non-default loan servicer, and the US Department of Education will remove the default status from the borrower’s credit reports.

Sign up for a new payment plan: Once you're out of default, you can sign up for another payment plan. The majority of borrowers sign up for one of the income-driven repayment plans that base their payments on a percentage of their discretionary income and an extended repayment term.

Not all borrowers are eligible for the Fresh Start program. Only federal student loan borrowers with the following defaulted loan types will qualify:

Direct loans, including Federal Stafford loans, Direct Consolidation loans, and PLUS loans offered via the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program (TEACH Grants converted to Direct Unsubsidized Loans are also eligible).

Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL) loans, including Federal Stafford loans, Federal Consolidation loans, and Federal PLUS loans.

Federal Perkins loans held by the US Department of Education.

Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Academic Competitiveness Grants, National SMART Grants, and TEACH Grants. (Note: you may have to repay part of a federal grant awarded to you.)

Other loans, including private student loans and privately held FFEL or Perkins loans, are ineligible. You can use the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) if you’ve defaulted on your student loan and are unsure of your loan type. If the loan or grant is not one of the program types listed above and is not assigned to the US Department of Education, the information on the NSLDS site does not apply to you.

The Fresh Start initiative is a one-time program; you cannot take advantage of it again. And if you default later, the government will report the date of your initial delinquency to the credit bureaus.

SAVE repayment plan

In 2023, the Biden administration announced the launch of a new IDR plan, the SAVE repayment plan. For low- to middle-income borrowers, the SAVE plan could significantly reduce their payments. It provides several benefits. Some won't go into effect until 2024, but these three perks will begin this summer:

It increases the amount of sheltered income

With all IDR plans, including the new SAVE plan, your payments are based on a percentage of your discretionary income. Currently, the other IDR plans define discretionary income as the difference between your actual income and 150% of the federal poverty guideline for your family size. But the SAVE plan adjusts the definition of discretionary income to the difference between your income and 225% of the federal poverty guideline.

For example, let's say you live in New York, are single, and earn $30,000 per year. The federal poverty guideline for a household of one is $14,580. The current IDR plans use 150% of the poverty guideline to determine your payments, so you would subtract $21,870 from your salary of $30,000 to find your discretionary income. In this scenario, your discretionary income is $8,130. Under the current IDR plans, payments cannot exceed 10% of your discretionary income, so your payments would total $813 per year or $67.75 per month.

Under the SAVE plan, discretionary income is defined as the difference between your salary and 225% of the federal poverty guideline. In this scenario, 225% of the federal poverty guideline for your family size is $32,805. Because your income is less than that, you have no discretionary income and would have $0 monthly payments. That means you won't have to pay anything toward your loans, but you won't enter default. And if you still have a balance at the end of your loan term, the remainder is forgiven.

The SAVE plan eliminates 100% of unpaid interest on subsidized and unsubsidized loans

As long as you make your payments on time, the government waives unpaid interest, so your loan balance won't grow over time. For example, if your loan accrues $50 per month in interest but your monthly payment is just $30, the government will waive the remaining $20.

Spousal income may be excluded

With some IDR plans, your spouse's income is included in the payment calculations, even if you file separate returns. But with SAVE, your spouse's income is excluded if you're married and file separately.

What to do to prepare for when student loan repayments resume

Payments are set to resume in October. To prepare, follow these steps:

Create a budget

If you haven't made payments toward your loans in years, your finances have likely changed quite a bit. Sit down and create a budget, outlining how much money you have coming in and going out every month. If your budget is too tight, look for areas where you can cut back or consider other repayment options for your student loans.

Find your student loan servicer

Your loans have likely changed loan servicers since 2020. And if the previous loan servicer didn't have your current address, you may not have received a notification. To find out where your loans are held — and to set up your payments to avoid late fees — you can sign in with the Federal Student Aid account dashboard or you can call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-433-3243.

Once you know who your servicer is, you can create an online account or contact customer support to change repayment plans or set up your monthly payments.

Enroll in the Fresh Start program

If you plan on taking advantage of the Fresh Start program, contact your loan holder at myeddebt.ed.gov or call 1-800-621-3115.

Enroll in a new repayment plan

On your loan servicer’s account dashboard, you can see what your minimum payment will be when payments resume in October 2023. If your payment under the current repayment plan is too high, you may be able to enroll in a new repayment plan, such as the new SAVE plan, to reduce your payments.

You can use the loan simulator tool to determine which plan gives you the lowest payments.

Apply for deferment or forbearance

If you are unable to make payments due to illness or unemployment, you may be able to postpone your payments under a federal forbearance or deferment program. Contact your loan servicer and explain your circumstances to find out what options are available.

Sign up for autopay

Signing up for automatic payments ensures you never miss a payment, but there is an added benefit: Federal loan servicers will also reduce your interest rate by 0.25%. Over time, that rate reduction can help you save money.

Make additional payments (if you can)

Not everyone will qualify for low monthly payments under an IDR plan. If you have to make payments under a standard 10-year repayment plan and want to get rid of your debt as quickly as possible, making extra payments is key.

For example, let's say you have $15,000 in student loans at 5% interest. With a 10-year repayment term, your monthly payment is $159 per month. If you increased your payments to $179 per month — adding an extra $20 to your monthly payments — you would pay off your loans 16 months early and save over $600.

Here is how much additional payments would affect your overall loan cost:

FAQs

Will student loan payments resume?

Federal student loans will start accruing interest on Sept. 1, 2023, and your payments will resume in October 2023.

Are private student loans eligible for the new repayment plans or the Fresh Start program?

No, private student loans aren't eligible for the Fresh Start initiative, SAVE repayment plan, or other federal benefits. If you have trouble affording the payments on a private student loan, contact your lender to see if an alternative payment plan is available.

Will I be able to have my student loans forgiven?

Although the Supreme Court struck down President Biden's debt relief plan, federal loan borrowers may be eligible for other forms of loan forgiveness. For example, those who work for nonprofit organizations may qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and some teachers may qualify for Teacher Loan Forgiveness. You can view all loan forgiveness and discharge programs on studentaid.gov.

How do I apply for the new SAVE repayment plan?

The Save Plan doesn't have a separate application yet. However, borrowers can still take advantage of it. If you are currently on the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) plan, you will automatically be enrolled in SAVE. If you are on a different plan, you can sign up for REPAYE online, and you will be enrolled in SAVE.","['Kat Tretina', 'February', 'Min Read']"

Not only does LightStream offer competitive APRs, it also has a generous 0.50% autopay discount and sweetens the deal by pledging to beat competitors’ rates by 0.10%. Borrowers also benefit from no prepayment penalties, origination, or application fees. Like SoFi, LightStream’s minimum loan amount is fairly high, so it’s likely only a good choice if you’re seeking a larger personal loan.

LendingClub: Best for a simple application process

Our take: LendingClub offers a streamlined application process that gives it an edge over competitors and makes life easier for borrowers.

Loan amount: $1,000-$50,000

Repayment terms: 24-72 months

Funding speed: As soon as one business day

Origination fee: 0% - 8%

LendingClub offers a fast and simple application process, allowing you to prequalify for a personal loan before formally applying. It also offers relatively low rates and fees, so it’s worth a look if you want to keep your borrowing costs low. This lender also lets you apply for a personal loan with a co-borrower.

While LendingClub has some perks, its origination fees can be fairly high and its repayment terms are less flexible than some competitors.

Discover: Best for low fees

Our take: Discover offers no origination fees, prepayment penalties, or application fees, and it also has a fairly low APR compared to its competitors.

Loan amount: $2,500-$40,000

Repayment terms: 36-84 months

Funding speed: As soon as one business day

Origination fee: None

With its lack of fees and competitive APRs, Discover gets high marks for personal loan affordability. It also offers relatively fast funding — as soon as one business day — and its reputation with customers is respectable.

Despite these positives, Discover’s loan terms aren’t as flexible as some competitors. You also can’t use a co-applicant to improve your chances of qualifying for a loan.

Navy Federal Credit Union: Best for military members

Our take: With fast funding, a lack of fees, and accessible customer support, Navy Federal’s personal loans are an excellent option for military members and veterans.

Loan amount: $250-$50,000

Repayment terms: 36-60 months

Funding speed: Same-day funding possible

Origination fee: None

The biggest drawback of Navy Federal is its restrictive credit union membership. Membership is open to veterans, active-duty and retired service members, eligible family members, and Department of Defense civilians.

If you qualify for membership and are seeking a personal loan, this lender offers several perks, including flexible loan amounts, fast funding, 24/7 customer support, and more. With the lowest minimum loan amount among all lenders we reviewed, this could be a low-fee option to predatory payday loans.

Best Egg: Best for custom payment options

Our take: Best Egg is unique among competitors because it offers a special payment option that could make it easier to repay your personal loan and save on interest.

Loan amount: $2,000-$50,000

Repayment terms: 36-60 months

Funding speed: As soon as one business day

Origination fee: 0.99%-9.99%

With Best Egg’s Payment Pathways program, borrowers benefit from a descending payment option. Your monthly payment starts higher but decreases the further you get into your loan term, which not only makes your personal loan more affordable but could make it easier to repay. Best Egg also offers a relatively low starting APR, making it ideal for borrowers with excellent credit who are seeking payment flexibility.

That said, you’ll want to be mindful of Best Egg’s origination fees, which can be as high as 9.99%. It also isn’t particularly transparent about its borrower requirements or whether co-applicants are allowed for its personal loans.

Upstart: Best for customer satisfaction

Our take: Upstart gets excellent ratings from online reviewers and provides ample email and phone support to borrowers, making it our top pick for customer satisfaction.

Loan amount: $1,000-$50,000

Repayment terms: 36 or 60 months

Funding speed: As soon as one business day

Origination fee: Not disclosed

Past Upstart customers have great things to say about this lender, and it offers accessible customer support for existing and new borrowers. Its loan amounts are flexible, making it suitable whether you want to borrow a little or a lot, and loans are disbursed quickly after approval.

Upstart isn’t transparent about its fees, though. It’s wise to discuss potential fees with customer support before proceeding with an application.

Upgrade: Best for excellent credit

Our take: Upgrade offers a very low starting APR compared to some competitors, making it a good choice for borrowers with excellent credit who want to keep interest costs low.

Loan amount: $1,000-$50,000

Repayment terms: 24-84 months

Funding speed: As soon as one business day

Origination fee: 1.85%-9.99%

If you have excellent credit, you might qualify for a low-rate personal loan with Upgrade. This lender does charge origination fees, though they could be on the lower side for well-qualified borrowers. Apart from a decent APR, Upgrade offers fast funding, flexible loan amounts, and an accessible customer service team.

That said, its fees can also be relatively high, so this is something to watch out for if you plan to apply. Consider prequalifying with a soft credit check before submitting a formal application.

Wells Fargo: Best for flexible terms

Our take: If you’re looking for a flexible repayment term, Wells Fargo offers personal loans with terms as short as one year or as long as seven years.

Loan amount: $3,000-$100,000

Repayment terms: 12-84 months

Funding speed: Same-day funding possible

Origination fee: None

Besides flexible repayment terms, Wells Fargo offers competitive APRs, no origination fees, and fast funding. Thus, it’s a great choice for borrowers seeking flexibility, those who want to keep their borrowing costs low, or people seeking funds quickly to cover an emergency expense.

While it has its perks, Wells Fargo’s feedback from online reviewers is limited and mostly negative. It’s also unclear if this lender allows you to apply with a co-borrower.

Rocket Loans: Best for fast funding

Our take: Rocket Loans offers quick funding for its personal loans compared to other lenders we evaluated. It also has an excellent reputation with borrowers.

Loan amount: $2,000-$45,000

Repayment terms: 36 or 60 months

Funding speed : Same-day funding likely

Origination fee: Up to 9%

If Rocket Loans approves your personal loan application before 4 p.m. ET on a weekday, you’re likely to receive same-day funding. Of course, disbursement time can vary on a case-by-case basis, but a same-day funding option still makes Rocket worth considering if you need to cover an emergency expense. This lender also has a good reputation with its customers.

That said, Rocket charges a fairly high origination fee, and its loan terms aren’t particularly flexible. These are important things to consider before you apply.

Avant: Best for customer support

Our take: Avant offers accessible customer support, with representatives available via email and phone seven days a week. It also has a stellar reputation among customers.

Loan amount: $2,000-$35,000

Repayment terms: 24-60 months

Funding speed: As soon as one business day

Origination fee: None, but has an administration fee of up to 9.99%

If accessible customer support is important to you, Avant is worth considering. Its team is available via phone and email seven days a week for at least 12 hours each day. Avant also gets high customer satisfaction ratings, perhaps due to its accessible support team and simple loan application process.

That said, this lender has some drawbacks. It charges a relatively high administration fee, and borrowers are on the hook for late and dishonored payment fees.

Prosper: Best for fair credit

Our take: Prosper has a minimum credit score requirement of 600 and lets you apply with a co-applicant if you can’t meet its criteria on your own.

Loan amount: $2,000-$50,000

Repayment terms: 24-60 months

Funding speed: As soon as one business day

Origination fee: 1%-9.99%

If you’ve had past credit setbacks and are concerned about your ability to qualify for a personal loan, Prosper may be worth considering. Borrowers with credit scores as low as 600 might qualify for its loans, and you can also apply with a trusted co-borrower to help increase your likelihood of approval. Prosper offers relatively fast funding, as soon as one business day after loan approval.

Despite Prosper’s perks, its origination fees are higher than some competitors. Borrowers may also be subject to other fees, including check payment fees, late fees, and insufficient funds fees.

Personal loan pros and cons

Pros

Versatility . Personal loan amounts are flexible, and you can use the loan funds for many financial goals. Repayment terms may be fine-tuned to your monthly cash flow.

No collateral required . Personal loans are typically unsecured. Qualifying for an unsecured personal loan means you won't have to put up your vehicle, savings account, or other asset to guarantee the loan.

Lower interest rates than credit cards . With good credit, you'll likely get an interest rate lower than you'll see with a credit card. Personal loans typically have fixed interest rates that don't change, while credit cards have variable rates that can fluctuate.

Easier to qualify for . The best personal loans are easier to qualify for than an auto or home equity loan. Borrower requirements also vary by lender, so credit score requirements may be more flexible with one lender compared to another.

Quick approval. The best personal loan lenders can process your loan approval and have cash in hand as soon as the next day. That speed for loan approvals is unique to personal loans.

Read more: Personal loan vs. credit card

Cons

Your interest rate might be higher than expected . Rates tend to be higher for unsecured personal loans, though secured personal loans are harder to come by. Consider the pros and cons of secured versus unsecured personal loans.

Potential fees . Personal loan lenders may charge fees, including origination fees up to 10%. Read the fine print before you apply.

More debt. Let's face it: Personal loans can be just one more thing to pay off. If you have a good to excellent credit score and manage debt well, that’s likely not a problem. But for those struggling in their current financial situation with a low credit score, think it through before taking on more debt.

Read more: What is a personal loan?

How to choose a personal loan

Good personal loans come with relatively low fixed rates and flexible repayment terms. But the best personal loan lenders go the extra mile by minimizing unnecessary fees, offering flexible credit score requirements, and ensuring responsive customer support. Here’s what to look at as you compare loan options.

Dig deeper: Is a personal loan right for me?

Interest rates and APR

Interest rates for personal loans tend to increase when the federal funds rate increases. While personal loan rates are trending higher, the rate you receive is based on your creditworthiness, at least in part.

Lenders consider your credit score, which is a measure of your creditworthiness based on your history of repaying debt, such as credit cards, vehicle loans, or a mortgage. They also review your debt-to-income ratio, or how much you owe on existing debt relative to your pre-tax earnings.

Lenders typically charge higher rates to borrowers with poor credit since they could be at a higher risk of nonpayment. Excellent-credit borrowers generally get the lowest personal loan rates. The lower your interest rate, the less you pay to borrow and the easier it is to afford your monthly payment.

You'll often see an interest rate quoted as an annual percentage rate (APR). The APR is your yearly cost of borrowing money and includes any fees or other charges. APRs offer a more accurate picture of your overall borrowing costs than interest rates alone.

Loan amount and terms

Your best personal loan choice will be based on your needs. Here are some best practices for choosing the right loan amount and term.

Borrow only what you need . Lenders who identify a qualified borrower are anxious to offer the maximum loan amount they believe the customer can afford. But that may be more than you need, putting you on the hook for more debt and interest. For example, if you need $7,000 and the lender approves you for a $10,000 loan because of your good credit, stick with the $7,000.

Consider what you can afford. Estimate your monthly payments based on different repayment terms to determine how your new loan payments will fit into your budget. Generally, a shorter repayment term means higher monthly payments and lower interest costs, while a longer term means lower monthly payments and higher interest costs.

Personal loan fees and charges

You’ll also want to compare fees and charges before choosing a personal loan. Common fees and charges to look for include:

Origination fee . Some lenders charge origination fees to cover loan processing. The fee is usually a percentage of the total loan, such as 1% or 10%. This is subtracted from your total loan amount when the money is disbursed, so be sure to factor that in when calculating your desired loan amount.

Application fee . Lenders may charge application fees, which are usually around $25 to $50 but can be as high as $500.

Prepayment penalty . Sometimes a fee is levied if you pay off a loan early. In effect, you're being penalized for reducing debt, so it’s smart to avoid a prepayment penalty if you can. None of the lenders we reviewed charges a prepayment penalty.

Late payment fee. If you don't pay on time, you'll likely get hit with a late fee. Getting behind on monthly payments will also negatively impact your credit score.

Credit score and eligibility

Look up your credit score and credit history before applying for a personal loan. That way, you can correct any errors or try to clean up any blemishes.

The higher your credit score, the better your personal loan terms and the lower your monthly payment will be. Credit scores generally range from 300 to 850. The average FICO score in the U.S. was 714 in 2024, according to Experian data.

Learn more: Average credit score by age: How do your scores compare?

Current interest rates vary by lender, but generally range from about 7% to 36% as of July 2025. Top-tier credit scores will earn the most favorable interest rate.

Some lenders do offer personal loans to borrowers with bad credit. Of course, your repayment terms will be less favorable, and the interest rate will be higher.

Lender customer service and reputation

Your lender choice is important. You want to find a lender with a good reputation, the services and perks you prefer, and the most favorable loan terms. Here’s what to look out for:

Prequalification . Some lenders let you prequalify, giving you an idea of potential loan amounts, rates, and terms without a formal application. Lenders do a soft credit check when you prequalify, and this type of credit check won’t harm your credit score.

Customer support and payment options . Research customer support and payment options before moving forward with an application. Does the lender offer an autopay discount? Is there phone and email support during the hours you'll likely need assistance?

Customer reviews. Real-life reviews offer the best insight into a lender's reputation. Sort customer reviews by ""most recent,"" if possible, to see the latest issues or complaints. Red flags can include last-minute changes to a borrower's interest rate or loan terms, disbursement or payment glitches, or issues with the functionality of a mobile app or website.

Learn more: What is the best place to get a personal loan?

Applying for a personal loan is simpler and requires less documentation than applying for other types of debt such as an auto loan. Step one is understanding your credit history and scores, as both help determine your interest rate. You can access your free credit reports at AnnualCreditReport.com and get insight into your scores through your credit card issuer, bank, or a third-party service like Credit Karma.

Next, consider how much you need to borrow and how fast you can pay it back. Remember that interest costs tend to be lower with a shorter repayment term, but your monthly payments will often be higher because you’re repaying your loan over a shorter time frame. You’ll usually pay more in interest with a longer-term loan.

It also makes sense to prequalify with a few different lenders to compare your options. Once you have two or three loan offers in hand, sit down and do a side-by-side comparison of each. Which lender gives you the best payment options and combination of loan terms and service? How much will you save over the life of the loan from the lowest APR offer compared to the least favorable? How quickly will the loan funds be available?

Once you’ve chosen your ideal lender, it’s time to apply online. Be prepared to share basic personal and financial information on your application, including proof of income. You’ll find out whether you qualify for a loan after your lender checks your credit and financial history. If you’re approved, your lender will likely disburse funds quickly, with some lenders offering next-day funding.

Personal loan FAQs

Can I use a personal loan to pay off credit card debt?

Absolutely. Consolidating high-interest credit card debt with a lower-rate personal loan could help you save on interest and make it easier to repay your debt.

Dig deeper: How to consolidate credit card debt with a personal loan

Can I apply for a personal loan with no credit check?

Yes, some lenders allow you to apply for a personal loan with no credit check. But a no-credit-check lender will likely offer smaller loans, shorter repayment terms, and high interest rates. Thus, a no-credit-check loan can be a risky financing option, so consider other financing options if possible.

Can I get a personal loan with bad credit?

Some personal loan lenders offer loans for borrowers with bad credit, but you'll likely pay a high interest rate. The lender may also require a co-applicant or a secured loan guaranteed by collateral.

How does a personal loan work?

A personal loan is a lump-sum installment loan issued by a bank, credit union, or online lender. If approved, you'll make monthly payments for a set term, often as long as five or seven years. You can use a personal loan for a variety of purposes, but are generally prohibited from using one for higher education, a home down payment, or for investing purposes.

Methodology

Lenders were scored across nine key evaluation categories that reflect critical aspects of the loan process. Data was collected from 18 personal loan lenders and carefully reviewed by our personal finance experts.

We graded each lender based on publicly available information found on their websites, disclosures and legal fine print, customer service policies, and consumer reviews from Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau. Categories include available APR range, applicable fees, offered loan amounts and terms, and customer support options. Each category was assigned a weight that corresponds to its relative importance and prioritizes consumer-friendly lending for individual, unsecured personal loans. Some subjective scoring is involved when clear information is unavailable.

What’s a good credit score?

Your credit score is a three-digit number that provides a snapshot to lenders of how responsible you are at managing debt. You actually have many different credit scores, but they’re all based on information in your credit reports from the three major credit bureaus, which are:

Equifax

Experian

TransUnion

Your credit scores are not a measure of your overall financial health. Essentially, they’re intended to show lenders how likely you are to repay the money you borrow.

FICO scores are the most widely used type of credit scores. They typically range between 300 to 850. Here’s a further breakdown of what these scores mean:

Less than 580: Poor

580-669: Fair

670-739: Good

740-799: Very good

800 or higher: Exceptional

The following factors determine your credit score:

Payment history (35%): The most important FICO score factor is whether you’ve made on-time payments for credit accounts in the past.

Credit utilization (30%): Your credit utilization ratio is the percentage of your available credit that you’re using. For example, if you have one credit card with a $10,000 limit and the balance is $2,000, you have 20% credit utilization.

Length of credit (15%): Having a long credit history tends to be good for your FICO scores. FICO considers a number of factors here, including the age of your oldest account and your newest account, the average age of all your accounts, and how long it’s been since you closed certain accounts.

New credit (10%): When you apply for credit, a hard inquiry appears on your credit report for two years, though FICO scores only consider hard inquiries from the last 12 months. It’s typically best to avoid applying for credit multiple times within a short window to avoid racking up too many hard credit inquiries.

Credit mix (10%): Having different types of credit, like a credit card, a mortgage, and an installment loan is generally good for your credit score.

Your scores will likely vary somewhat depending on which bureau is providing the information. Also, it’s normal for credit scores to fluctuate slightly from month to month.

Not everyone has a credit score, though. If you haven’t had an account that reports to the bureaus, like a credit card or loan, within the last six months, the bureaus might not have enough information to calculate your credit score.

10 ways to improve your credit score in 2025

If you’re ready to start improving your credit in 2025, follow this roadmap.

1. Look for errors on your credit reports

Your credit reports won’t show your credit scores, but they’re the source of the information that’s used to calculate your scores. If you discover errors and have them removed, you might see your credit score go up.

You can get a free credit report each week from AnnualCreditReport.com, but it’s usually not necessary to check your credit reports that frequently. A good practice is to review each of your credit reports at least once a year, or every few months if you’re planning to finance a major purchase soon. You should also check your credit reports whenever you’re notified that you were part of a data breach or if you think your personal information was compromised.

Some examples of things to look out for when you check your credit reports:

Errors in your identifying information, like your name, phone number, or address

Accounts you don’t recognize or that incorrectly list you as the owner

Payments listed as late that you made on time

Incorrect balances or credit limits on your accounts

The same account listed multiple times (which sometimes happens with name changes or when an account goes to collections)

Hard inquiries for new accounts that you didn’t apply for

Should you discover mistakes on your credit reports, dispute them as soon as possible with the bureau that provided the report. Your credit report will provide information about how you can do so.

2. Pay your bills on time

Making on-time payments is the No. 1 thing you can do to build a good credit score, as payment history is the top credit score factor. Just one late payment (defined as 30 days or more past the due date, though late fees are often charged immediately) can cause your credit score to nosedive. Past-due or missed payments usually stay on your credit reports for seven years, though the impact on your credit scores fades over time.

You’ll only build payment history for accounts that report to the credit bureaus, like credit cards and personal loans. Unfortunately, paying your electric bill or cell phone on time each month is unlikely to help your credit because these payments are seldom reported to the bureaus. However, if you become delinquent on one of these expenses and the account goes to collections, you’ll damage your credit score.

3. Ask a loved one to make you an authorized user

An authorized user on a credit card is someone who has permission from the primary account holder to make purchases, but isn’t responsible for payments. Becoming an authorized user on an account owned by someone who has good credit can give your credit a lift. On the flipside, it could hurt your credit if the account holder misses payment or maxes out their card.

If you have a loved one who’s financially responsible, ask them if they’d let you piggyback on their creditworthiness by becoming an authorized user. Just don’t abuse the privilege if they say yes. Get their permission before actually making any purchases with their card.

4. Get a credit card if you don’t have one

It’s a Catch-22: Building credit without a credit card is challenging, but getting approved for the credit card you need to start building credit is also hard.

If you don’t already have your own credit card, you’re going to want to get one in order to build a top-notch score. Some options if you’re seeking your first credit card (or you haven’t had a credit card in a while):

Secured credit cards: Getting approved for a secured credit card is fairly easy because you pay a refundable security deposit that becomes your line of credit. Many secured cards include the option to upgrade to a regular credit card after you’ve built a history of on-time payments.

Unsecured starter credit cards: Some unsecured credit cards (meaning they don’t require a deposit) are designed for people who don’t have much of a credit history or who have bad credit.

Store credit cards: Retail credit cards — specifically, closed-loop credit cards that can only be used at a specific store — are often easier to qualify for than regular credit cards, though the requirements can vary widely depending on the retailer.

Student credit cards: If you’re enrolled in school, getting a student credit card is a good way to build credit, as these cards are designed specifically for people with a limited history.

When you get approved for your first new credit card, you’ll typically have a low credit limit and a high annual percentage rate (APR). The reason is that lenders perceive a borrower who’s new to credit as a greater risk.

Aim to only charge what you can pay off in full by the due date so you won’t be charged interest. Also, try to keep your credit utilization rate below 30%. For instance, if you get approved for a card with a $300 limit, don’t let the balance exceed $90.

5. Look for a credit-builder loan

You can also establish credit through a credit-builder loan, which is like a loan in reverse: You pay your financial institution each month, and they report the payments to the credit bureau. But unlike a regular personal loan, you get the money at the end of the term after making all payments, instead of the beginning.

Credit-builder loans typically have terms ranging from six to 24 months. You’re most likely to find them at smaller community banks and local credit unions.

6. Request a credit limit increase

Once you’ve proven your creditworthiness — or if you already have a credit card and a solid payment history – consider asking your card issuer to increase your credit limit. By having more open credit, you’ll automatically decrease your credit utilization as long as you don’t increase your balance. You’ll typically want to wait at least six months before making this request, though.

7. Get your rent payments in front of the credit bureaus

Most landlords don’t report rent payments to the credit bureaus, so even the best rental history won’t normally boost your credit score. But the credit bureaus will report your rental history if they have it.

Several rent reporting services relay your rent payment info to the credit bureaus. You’ll probably need your landlord to enroll, and many of these services charge a small fee that you’re responsible for paying. The cost may be worth it, though, to show your track record of paying what’s likely one of your largest bills on time.

How this information is handled depends on the credit scoring model. FICO’s newer scoring models incorporate rental payments when they’re reported, but the older models that are still used for mortgages don’t take rental history into account. VantageScore, an alternative type of credit score, incorporates rental payments when they’re available into all of its credit scoring models.

8. Avoid closing old credit cards

Because length of credit determines 15% of your credit score, avoid closing old credit cards unless you have a compelling reason, like the card has a high annual fee. Even if you have other credit cards with better rewards programs, use your older cards for the occasional purchase or a small recurring bill.

9. Pay off debt strategically

Not all debt payoff benefits your credit score equally. Paying off your credit cards usually helps your score more than paying off loans. That’s because when you pay off a credit card, you lower your credit utilization, which is the second-most important credit score factor. Since credit cards typically charge higher APRs than loans, you can also save money on interest.

However, if you have any loans that charge exorbitant interest rates, pay those off first before you tackle credit cards. For example, payday loans frequently charge APRs of nearly 400%, which can leave you trapped in debt. Your credit score is unlikely to benefit from getting rid of payday loans, as most lenders don’t report to credit bureaus, but your personal finances will be much healthier for it.

10. See if a debt consolidation loan will save you money

A debt consolidation loan is a personal loan that you use to lump several high-interest debts into a lower-interest loan with a single monthly payment. For example, if you had three credit cards with interest rates of 16%, 18%, and 21%, but you qualified for a personal loan with a 10% APR, consolidating debt with a personal loan could save you money. Since you’d lower your credit utilization, your credit score would likely benefit, as well.

Interest rates remain somewhat elevated as the new year starts, so be cautious before going forward with debt consolidation. But if you’re juggling multiple high-interest credit card accounts, you could still save money and improve your credit score.

Make sure you consider the interest savings from debt consolidation for the long term. Some debt consolidation loans lower your monthly debt payments but cause you to pay more interest over time because they have longer repayment terms.

How to keep building good credit

Once you have good credit, you want to keep that momentum and watch your score climb even higher. You’ll often find that once you’ve established your creditworthiness and have good financial habits, your credit score will continue its upward trajectory. Sticking to a budget and keeping your debt levels manageable are key to maintaining a healthy credit score.

As you rack up a history of on-time payments and keep your credit card balances low, your score will continue improving. As credit card companies see over time that they can trust you to repay money, they may even automatically increase your credit limits, often boosting your score even further.

Building good credit is a long-term game. If you stay focused and take baby steps, you can make 2025 the year your credit score shines.

Worried you might not be eligible for a personal loan? Here’s the inside scoop on personal loan requirements and how to maximize your chances of approval.

This embedded content is not available in your region.

5 common personal loan requirements

Lender requirements vary for personal loan borrowers, so it’s important to research and compare options before applying. Generally, though, you’ll need to provide the following:

1. Valid identification

Lenders generally require that you confirm your age and identity by providing a copy of a government-issued ID. Acceptable forms of identification may be a driver’s license, passport, military ID, Social Security card, or birth certificate, but check with the lender for specifics.

2. Proof of residence or address

You may also need to share proof of address. Valid documents may include a utility bill in your name, a copy of your lease or mortgage, a voter registration card, or a copy of your homeowners or auto insurance policy listing your address.

3. Consistent income

Lenders may have income requirements, such as earning a minimum of $25,000 annually, though this isn’t always the case. Regardless, you'll need to prove you have steady income or ample savings to afford your monthly payments. Pay stubs, bank statements, and other documentation for employment and income verification are typically required.

4. Manageable debt

Just because you have enough money coming in doesn’t mean you have the cash on hand to make your personal loan payments. Lenders consider your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) to measure your ability to make a loan payment.

Your DTI is expressed as a percentage and reflects how much of your gross monthly income goes toward existing debt, such as auto loans or credit card payments. Lenders often prefer a DTI below 36%.

5. Acceptable credit score and history

You don’t need perfect credit to qualify for a personal loan, though many lenders require at least good credit. Good credit scores range from 670 to 739. Some lenders may also accept fair credit (580 to 669), though you’ll typically end up with a higher interest rate.

How to increase your likelihood of approval

Understanding what lenders require is just the first step. The next step is determining how to improve your chances of qualifying for a personal loan. Here are some tips.

1. Check your credit

Before applying, check your credit reports for inaccuracies. You can get free copies of your credit reports at AnnualCreditReport.com. If you notice any errors, you can file a dispute with the credit bureaus and fix the issue before applying for a loan.

Note that your credit scores won’t appear on your credit reports. But banks and credit card issuers often allow you to check your credit scores for free. Since many lenders require good credit, understanding where your credit score stands is important before applying for a loan.

2. Shore up your finances

Before you start to compare loan options, make sure your financial house is in order. Consider supplementing your income with a side gig if your monthly debt payments are high. Ensure you’re up to date on monthly debt payments, limit your credit card spending to reduce your credit utilization, and set up automatic payments so you won’t miss a bill.

If your credit score isn’t great, these steps could help boost it before you apply for a loan.

3. Calculate what you can afford

Next, determine how much you need to borrow and how long you’ll need to pay it back. Estimate your interest rate and use a loan calculator to determine a potential monthly payment. Personal loans often have repayment terms as long as seven years or as short as a year or two.

Knowing what you can comfortably afford before applying for a loan could help increase your chances of approval.

Do you need to prequalify for a personal loan?

While it’s not strictly necessary, it’s a good idea to prequalify for a loan with a few different lenders. You can often input a few pieces of personal information on the lender's website, and the lender will show you the estimated interest rates and loan terms you might qualify for.

Although the interest rate isn’t guaranteed, prequalification allows you to see the lender’s personal loan rates and your estimated monthly payment. While prequalifying with your current bank or credit union offers a good starting point, you’ll also want to prequalify with other lenders. Doing so will let you compare potential loan offers, helping you find the best and most affordable option.

It’s worth mentioning that the prequalification process involves a soft credit check, which won’t impact your credit score. Once you submit a full application, the lender will initiate a hard credit check, which will show up on your credit reports and could affect your credit score.

Obviously, friends, family and health. But there are some other holiday fringe benefits, too. For some, it's all about the food. For others, it means watching a parade. For many of us, that NFL football triple header is a big attraction. And whether you're a bargain hunter or you're just starting your Christmas shopping a bit early, there are those Black Friday deals. Spoiler alert: The best deals are already up and running, and we've pulled together the best tech and gadget options right here.

Before the real chaos begins, a quick primer: Black Friday deals come in layers. Some are genuinely excellent price drops (like the $69 AirPods 4), some are recycled discounts dressed up for the holiday, and some aren't deals at all. This year, though, the standouts are obvious — AirPods 4 with ANC for $100, AirPods Pro 3 for $220 (lowest price ever), the latest iPad for $274, a Quinlianf 5-outlet charger for just $9 to power it all and even a rare Disney+ sale (the Mouse almost never discounts anything). Even AirTags are within a dollar of their best-ever price.

Trending Black Friday tech deals

PlayStation PlayStation 5 Digital Edition (slim) $399 $500 Save $101 | Lowest price this year When you couldn't care less about owning a physical library of games, the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition is here for you. The Digital Edition always retails for less than the disc version, but right now it's even more appealing, after a 20% Black Friday price drop. It's the best price this year by 9%, and this edition still has the same 825GB SSD, with blitz-worthy download speeds, haptic immersion and marvelous audio. Instead of buying discs, a connection to the PlayStation store enables you to buy offline and download directly onto your machine. The downside is that you won't have access to used games and some third-party game sales, but you'll save money up front, especially right now.

But if your goal is to find the cheapest factory-new MacBook you can buy, this is it. Yes, the M1 chip is a couple of generations old — Apple's latest Air laptops run on the M4 (and the M5 has already been announced) — but compared to the Intel models it replaced, the jump in speed and efficiency is still huge. With 8GB RAM, it's still more than capable for students and everyday work, and at this price, it's easily the most affordable way to break into the MacBook lineup. $549 at Walmart

Amazon Nex Playground $249 Since the sun now sets at roughly the time my toddler finishes her after-school snack — and takes the temps down with it — we've officially entered indoor-activity season. The Nex Playground is basically a cross between a gaming console and a kid-friendly fitness system (think a modernized Nintendo Wii, minus the remotes that used to launch themselves into TV screens). It uses motion tracking to turn jumping, balancing and general wiggling into gameplay that even I enjoy, especially the two-player stuff. More than 50,000 people have picked one up in the past month, and right now it's 20% off at $199 with five games included. $249 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $250 at Target$250 at Best Buy

Black Friday FAQs

When is Black Friday this year?

Black Friday always falls on the day after Thanksgiving, which this year is Friday, Nov. 28. It used to be a one-day event, but these days, anyone calling it a single-day sale is either lying or completely out of touch. Most major retailers will roll out discounts weeks in advance — think of it as ""Black November."" That means you'll want to start keeping tabs on prices now, and who knows? You might be done with all of your holiday shopping before the turkey coma hits.

Does Black Friday have deals on everything?

Not necessarily everything, but pretty dang close. We're already seeing close to record-low prices on TVs, laptops and headphones, and it's common to see gaming consoles and appliances go on sale too.

Does every store have a sale?

Pretty much. The usual suspects — Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Macy's, Kohl's, Wayfair, The Home Depot — will all go big. Smaller brands often join in too, though some do it quietly (think: an unadvertised 20% off code hidden at checkout). Others, like REI, make a point to not have a sale with the rest of them, instead opting for earlier sales. The point is, if you're shopping online at all this fall, there's no excuse to pay full price.

How to shop Black Friday like a pro

Have a plan (or even better, a spreadsheet): Ever end up overspending while grocery shopping when you don't have a list? Me too. Don't wait until the week of Thanksgiving (or later) to decide what to buy. Create a wishlist and track prices starting now. Once that dream TV, laptop or pair of noise-cancelling headphones drops to a real all-time low, jump on it — good deals don't linger.

Do your homework: Don't rely on a single retailer. In most cases, it pays to shop around. Case in point: This past October Prime Day, Amazon had almost every single Apple device on sale, except for the brand new AirPods Pro 3, which were $249 at most retailers. I found them on sale at Sam's Club, which isn't usually first on my list when it comes to tech shopping (though the chain remains my favorite for $5 rotisserie chicken). Prices also tend to fluctuate, so don't assume the first small markdown you see is the best one.

Be skeptical: Here's a dirty little secret: Some ""sales"" aren't really sales. Retailers bump prices before big events so the discount looks steeper. Web tools like Honey or CamelCamelCamel can show you price history (to see if that 95% off gadget has ever sold at MSRP), but if you don't feel like going full spreadsheet mode, I'll be doing that work for you all month long — rounding up legit deals, not the fake ones.

The best sales to shop before Black Friday (for tech and more):

Many retailers are offering early discounts to help you get ahead of the Black Friday rush.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,More housing markets are shifting toward buyers. It’s not enough to make them want to buy.,"As the year draws to a close, homebuyers are gaining ground. Mortgage rates are hovering near year-to-date lows, and in a growing number of metro areas, market conditions now outright favor buyers.

The only problem? Many of these newfound buyer’s markets lack buyers.

As of October, sellers outnumbered buyers nationwide by 37%, according to Redfin, creating the strongest buyer’s market since at least 2013. Buyers are in control when they have more inventory to choose from, which, in turn, helps limit home price appreciation. But despite these conditions, buyers, feeling stymied by high costs and economic worries, are exiting the market faster than sellers.

The shift underscores how small affordability gains aren’t enough to unfreeze a housing market where prices are more than 50% higher than pre-pandemic levels and mortgage rates are above 6%. At these levels, many aspiring buyers, especially first-timers, remain effectively shut out. As a result, home sales this year are on track to spend their third straight year near 30-year lows.

“Buyers are just feeling the pain of many years of home price increases, on top of interest rates still in the 6% range,” said Molly Boesel, senior principal economist at property data provider Cotality.

Read more: Is it a buyer's market or a seller's market? How to tell the difference.

Where buyers are making inroads

Even though buyers stay hesitant, they’re gaining leverage in more parts of the country. Buyers have long enjoyed the biggest upper hand in southern cities like Houston, San Antonio, Nashville, and Jacksonville, Fla., which have prioritized new building and seen their population growth slow since the pandemic. As of October, cities like Cincinnati and Milwaukee have also transitioned to become buyer’s markets, according to Zillow data.

The listings giant now considers 19 major metro areas to be tilted toward buyers, up from nine a year ago.

Buyers are usually considered to have more power when it would take six months or more to sell all active listings on the market, while markets tilt toward sellers when there’s under four months of supply.

Greg Langhaim, a real estate agent and owner of Go Idaho Group in Meridian, Idaho, said buyers in the Boise area have turned hesitant this year, even though the region’s inventory remains constrained enough to be considered a seller's market.

“We have all these buyers who are sitting because they’re doing the math, and it’s just not adding up,” Langhaim said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty, and our wages aren’t matching up with the prices.”","['Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Tech's Hollywood takeover. A streaming giant on steroids. Another contentious battle for IP and scale.

The $72 billion Netflix (NFLX) deal to acquire the studio and streaming assets of Warner Bros. Discovery crisscrosses and amplifies multiple narratives in the entertainment business. It would combine the world's top streamer with one of the most storied film and TV studios.

But the mash-up, which Netflix expects to take up to 18 months to complete, is already prompting vocal pushback from another suitor and media rival as well as elected officials from both parties.

Antitrust issues are only part of the uncertainty. The tie-up underscores the still-unsettled challenges surrounding the future of moviegoing, cable's great dwindling, and the creative industry's uneasy relationship with the dominant players in technology.

Here are five questions about what's next for Netflix:

1. What will Paramount do to squash the deal?

Paramount (PSKY) has already expressed dissatisfaction with how the negotiations have gone down. And it can do more.

Analysts say Paramount is eager to grab WBD's back catalog and IP to compete with the much larger Netflix. That growth is pivotal to Paramount's success, motivating its desire to acquire WBD, and now to try and block Netflix from doing so.

In addition to raising legal challenges, Paramount can lean on its political ties with the Trump administration to stymie the Netflix proposal. Comcast (CMCSA), another suitor that offered a bid, could also strengthen the case against a Netflix deal.

2. How is the political opposition shaping up?

What Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has described as ""[giving] audiences more of what they love"" several elected leaders see as ingredients for market abuse. ""This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren in a post on X Friday.

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 12: (L-R) Eddie Murphy and Ted Sarandos, Co-CEO, Netflix attend Netflix's ""Being Eddie"" premiere at Netflix Tudum Theater on November 12, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Presley Ann/Getty Images for Netflix) · Presley Ann via Getty Images

""A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market. It could force you into higher prices, fewer choices over what and how you watch, and may put American workers at risk,"" Warren wrote.

The opposition to the deal isn't limited to the Democratic side. Several Republican lawmakers have criticized the deal and have called on regulators to scrutinize the acquisition.

3. How can Netflix overcome antitrust concerns?

Similar to Meta's recent anti-monopoly victory in court, Netflix can make the case that the tech environment continues to change. And that its rivals, a who's who of well-resourced mega platforms including Apple, Amazon, and YouTube, are all clamoring for user attention and streaming turf.","['Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Working while collecting Social Security: The 'slow fade' to retirement more people are choosing,"Claiming Social Security while still working isn’t an outlier these days.

It’s pretty common, according to a recent report by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, which found that 2 in 5 people combine work and benefits for at least some period of time.

Count among them Sharon Smith, who started her Social Security benefit at 67, even though she wasn’t retiring.

Smith, an executive coach and business consultant who splits her year between Naples, Fla. and Boston, had reached full-retirement age and was ready for a career transition.

“I stepped out of a high-pressure management job, and I needed a break to focus on my health and morph into a new career,” she said.

The income from the monthly Social Security check was an important key to that process.

“My husband and I needed that money as I built up my coaching business, and I'm glad we've had it,” she said. “I'm able to not feel like I have to do things I don't want to do, or to take a job or not.”

Combining work and benefits

Social Security was created to provide income for those no longer working, but today, many households over age 65 report earnings from a job and Social Security income. Although the labor force participation rate declines sharply after people reach age 62, recent studies show that earnings from a job constitute more than a fifth of income for households over age 65, Siyan Liu, a co-author of the report, told Yahoo Finance.

People who work after claiming benefits fall into two distinct groups: More than two-thirds are low earners who claim early, Liu said. “They typically work part time and need to use Social Security to supplement earnings.”

The remaining third are higher earners who claim around their full retirement age and often continue to work full time. “Their combined income typically exceeds pre-claiming levels, suggesting some could postpone claiming until 70 to maximize monthly benefits,” she added.

How it works

You can take Social Security as early as age 62, but your benefit can be reduced as much as 30% from what it would have been at your Full Retirement Age (FRA). For anyone born in 1960 or later, your FRA is 67.

If you delay benefits from your FRA until age 70, you earn delayed retirement credits. Those come to roughly an 8% increase for each year until you hit 70, when the credits stop accruing.

Moving in and out of the job market before permanently retiring can have implications for your Social Security benefit. If you continue to work after claiming Social Security benefits after age 62 and before your FRA, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will temporarily withhold a portion of your benefits for earnings over a certain threshold, roughly $23,000.","['Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"

Yet more than half say they're guessing at the magic sum they’ll need to feel financially secure in retirement, according to a new survey by the nonprofit Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.

Based on median numbers, women workers across generations estimate they will need $500,000 to meet their goal. At the top end, about a quarter reckoned $2 million or more, and 15% of respondents estimated needing between $1 million and $2 million.

“That guessing stat stood out to me,” Lindsey Stanberry, founder of The Purse newsletter about women and money, told Yahoo Finance.

Me too — especially considering nearly half of the women surveyed say their greatest retirement fear is outliving their savings and investments.

“This is consistent with what I've seen when interviewing women,” Stanberry said. “I ask women to share their top financial worries, and nearly all of them mention concern about having enough saved for retirement.”

Some of these women are in their 40s and have more than a million already saved for retirement, she added. “They have good, consistent savings habits and, in some cases, access to employer-sponsored retirement plans with generous matching programs — and yet still they feel unsure it will be enough.”

Women are 'still losing'

“Nothing earth-shattering here,” Cary Carbonaro, a certified financial planner and the author of the book “Women and Wealth,” told me after she reviewed the report.

“What hasn't changed in decades: Women are less confident than men about retirement, emergency funds are lower than men’s, fewer women work with advisers, and more women are guessing about retirement,” she added.

Only 1 in 4 women have a financial strategy for retirement in the form of a written plan, and just 3 in 10 currently use a professional financial advisor, per the data.

“What I find is the women working and hiring advisers only do so when it is raining,” Carbonaro said. “Or that's what I call it. It is death, disability, job loss, divorce. Men will hire an adviser when the sun is shining. Women have to do better at that and not think about getting help only during a crisis.”

Another red flag: These workers are dipping into their retirement savings before they retire.

According to the findings, almost 4 in 10 women workers have taken a loan and/or early withdrawal from their retirement accounts.","['Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"

""We're pleased to see growth once again in our total customer count, with disproportionate growth coming from higher-income households,"" Dollar General (DG) CEO Todd J. Vasos told investors on the company's earnings call. The company reported same-store sales growth of 2.5% during the quarter, surpassing the Street's expectations.

Dollar Tree (DLTR) said it gained 3 million new shoppers across all income brackets in the quarter.

Roughly 60% of its new shoppers are high-income households, which the company defined as earning over $100,000. That's up from 50% of new shoppers earlier this year in the first quarter, according to Dollar Tree CEO Michael Creedon.

Meanwhile, 30% of those shoppers are middle-income consumers, earning between $60,000 and $100,000, and the rest are lower-income consumers, making under $60,000.

In the third quarter, Creedon said ""spending growth was broad-based across all income sub-cohorts, including households earning below $20,000.""

""This demonstrates that Dollar Tree isn't just for tough times or for those with limited resources,"" Creedon told investors on the company's earnings call. Sales growth of 4.2% was driven by its multi-price assortment.

He added, ""Higher-income households are trading into Dollar Tree, [and] lower-income households are depending on us more than ever.""

Five Below (FIVE) also got a boost this past quarter. Same-store sales growth, which grew more than 14% in the quarter, was ""widespread across most departments, new and retained customers, and all household income cohorts.""

The rise in shoppers turning to dollar stores and other discount retailers, such as Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), and TJ Maxx (TJX), comes as evolving trade policy created heightened economic anxiety among both consumers and businesses over the past year.

Consumer sentiment has also waned throughout the year. It rose for the first time in five months in December.

A mixed job market has also impacted consumers' mindsets. Layoffs year to date have surpassed 1.1 million, per Challenger, Gray & Christmas. It's the sixth time that's happened since 1993. In November, layoffs came in around 71,000. That's less than the 150,000 in October but up 24% compared to last November.

During the shortened holiday week, ending Nov. 30, jobless claims — those filing for unemployment benefits — came in at 191,000, which was a three-year low. Plus, a new report from ADP out on Wednesday showed US private payrolls slowed significantly last month, with 32,000 jobs lost.","['Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"

To many, hitting this financial milestone signals you’ve “made it.” With assets valued at seven figures, you can wave goodbye to many of the financial stressors that nagged at you when you had less.

However, with inflation eroding the value of the dollar with each passing year, being a millionaire doesn’t mean what it used to. As a result, there are more millionaires today than there used to be, and becoming one might be more within your reach.

Read on to learn more about how many millionaires there are in the U.S. today and ways you can grow your net worth to become a millionaire too.

What does it mean to be a millionaire today?

The term “millionaire” can have a range of different meanings depending on who you ask. Some people may define a millionaire as someone who earns a seven-figure income each year. But the most widely accepted definition is someone with a net worth of at least $1 million.

That said, within the world of millionaires, there’s an incredibly broad range of wealth. For instance, having a net worth of $1 million may not even be enough to retire, depending on how much you spend each year. But having a net worth of $10 million or $100 million affords you a completely different lifestyle — one in which you largely don’t need to worry about financial security.

How many millionaires are there in America?

According to Swiss bank USB’s 2025 Global Wealth Report, there were 23,831,000 millionaires in the United States in 2024. Compared to other countries, this is by far the largest number of millionaires, comprising nearly 40% of millionaires worldwide.

The number of millionaires is also growing in many parts of the world, including the United States. Though the number of millionaires is growing at a much faster rate in countries such as India and China, the U.S. still had 1.5% more millionaires compared to the previous year’s Global Wealth Report. In other words, the U.S. gained roughly 379,000 millionaires in a single year, which translates to over a thousand new millionaires each day.

However, it’s important to note that wealth isn't equally distributed among different races in America. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, 1 in 5 households with a white householder had a net worth of at least $1 million. For households with a Black householder, that ratio falls to 1 in 20.

Millionaire money habits to adopt

No two millionaires are the same, but many share common behaviors that have helped them achieve this financial milestone. If you want to become a millionaire, too, consider adopting some of the following habits millionaires use to make money:

Invest early

The more time you have on your side, the easier it is to become a millionaire. That’s because compound interest allows your investments to grow exponentially over time. The earlier you start investing, the less you need to put away to reach millionaire status.

Read more: The number one way Americans are becoming millionaires

Reduce your expenses

It sounds simple, but reducing how much you spend each month is one of the simplest ways to accelerate your path to becoming a millionaire. The less you spend, the more you can invest.

So, cut discretionary spending that doesn’t add a lot of value to your life, and see if you can negotiate or find better deals on essential expenses, such as your phone plan or rent.

Increase your income

While expenses are one side of the cash flow equation, income is the other. If you’ve cut all you can from your spending, brainstorm ways to earn more — either by negotiating a raise or adding income streams through side hustles or gig work.

Be cautious with debt

Millionaires are often cautious with debt because they understand how interest charges can snowball. By saving up an emergency fund and paying for discretionary expenses out of pocket, you can avoid expensive loans and credit card bills, putting more cash toward your nest egg.

Use tax-advantaged accounts

Certain accounts offer tax incentives to make your retirement contributions go further. For example, traditional IRAs and 401(k)s let you contribute pre-tax income, meaning you don’t pay taxes on the money you put in until you make withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s offer the reverse: You pay taxes on contributions now, but withdrawals are tax-free.

Ask for help when you need it

You don’t need to understand everything about personal finance to become a millionaire. But if you need help reaching your financial goals, you can always hire a pro. A good financial advisor can help you prioritize your goals and chart a path to reach them.

Think long-term

Most millionaires don’t achieve a seven-figure net worth by accident. Instead, they think long-term. They understand that their financial habits now will have major consequences in the future, and they invest, save, and plan accordingly.

While achieving millionaire status may feel far-fetched, having a seven-figure net worth might be more common — and attainable — than you realize. With a long-term vision, consistent saving and investing, and other good financial habits, you’ll be on track to a better financial future, millionaire or not.

Many retirees and near-retirees might be curious about investing in crypto but unsure whether to take the plunge.

Philip Martin, chief security officer for Coinbase Global, believes that individuals nearing or in retirement should consider investing in digital assets.

""Just like any diversified portfolio, crypto can be a component of a retiree's or near-retiree's assets,"" Martin said in a recent Decoding Retirement podcast. ""But also, I think they should think about it as something that's really important to learn about.""

This embedded content is not available in your region.

For one, he noted that major household-name financial firms, such as BlackRock (BLK), are now launching crypto ETFs after doing a significant amount of due diligence. Other wealth managers, such as Bank of America (BAC), have even endorsed allocating a small portion of their portfolio to crypto.

That alone, Martin said, signals that crypto is here to stay.

Proponents also point to the broader adoption of crypto in real-world use cases. Cross-border payments are faster and cheaper. Remittances are more efficient. And tokenization enables the transacting of real-world assets, such as real estate, on the blockchain with fewer intermediaries. That has the potential to reshape the underpinnings of finance, Martin said.

To be sure, many near-retirees and retirees might be intimidated by the language of crypto, such as tokenization and blockchain. But Martin said these terms can be learned.

Blockchain is the underlying system that enables cryptocurrencies to move. It can be complex in implementation, but what most people need to know is this: It is public, anyone can see it, anyone can write to it, and once something is confirmed, it cannot be changed, he said.

It's not anonymous, although many people think it is, Martin said. It's pseudo-anonymous. Names aren't stored, but addresses — think of them like account numbers — are visible. That creates a level of transparency that is different from handing someone $20, which leaves no public record.

Tokenization refers to dividing a real-world asset, such as a fund, Treasury, real estate, or gold, into chunks on the blockchain. Instead of thinking about the blockchain as just moving currency, it can move virtually any asset.

Asia Pacific borrowers increased euro‑denominated issuance to a record 23% of the total across both currencies this year, up six percentage points from 2024, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Euro note sales by companies and governments rose 75% in 2025 to €86.4 billion ($100.7 billion).

Most Read from Bloomberg

Multiple Asian deals ranked as the most oversubscribed in Europe’s publicly syndicated debt market during their launch week, the data showed. US dollar deals still make up the majority of financing deals, and borrowing in the greenback is up 29% by Asian issuers this year. But the market share declined, and the American edge for funding may be slowly eroding.

“A key driver is the need to diversify away from US dollar concentration,” said Daniel Kim, co-head of debt capital markets for Asia Pacific at HSBC. “This year’s surge in euro-denominated bond issuance stems from a confluence of strategic motives that go beyond the routine refinancing.”

US President Trump’s trade moves this year, and his pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates despite inflation concerns, has shaken investors’ confidence in the dollar’s pre-eminence, prompting investors to lean into euro assets. Asian borrowers have followed suit, with euro bond issuance surging to meet demand for diversification, while the greenback slid 11% against the euro.

“De-dollarization or diversification of investment portfolios to have more deployment in non-dollar currencies is a theme we have witnessed this year,” said Ben Wang, head of offshore China debt capital markets at Deutsche Bank AG.

The euro accounted for a smaller portion of Deutsche Bank’s APAC bond trading volume at the beginning of the year, but accounted for “more than 10%, even 20%” after entering the second half, he said.

The boom is also being driven by lower funding costs, with some Asian borrowers able to raise money more cheaply in euros than in dollars or their home currencies. The premium that investors pay to swap euros into dollars is at a near five-year low of 3.1 basis points, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.","['Finbarr Flynn', 'Tasos Vossos', 'Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"

After all, the next Fed chair — Hassett is the frontrunner — could join the board as soon as February, rendering Powell essentially a lame duck for the last few months of his chairmanship.”

That said, more Fed drama lies on the horizon. President Donald Trump is expected soon to name a successor to Powell, whose term as chair expires in May. Kevin Hasset, a Trump loyalist and senior economic adviser, is the frontrunner. That’s prompted worries among some investors that the next chair will pursue rate cuts at Trump’s direction and risk spurring inflation.

Economists polled by Bloomberg then expect the Fed to take a break before two more reductions in 2026, in March and September. And there’s some hope that a flood of new data — as statistical agencies catch up from the shutdown — will resolve the ongoing tension between the Fed’s mandates to contain inflation and maximize employment.

Against that backdrop and for about a week in mid-November, investors signaled serious doubt over the prospect of another cut. But the unusual level of drama was resolved on Nov. 21 when New York Fed President John Williams, who is seen as closely aligned with Powell, said he saw room for a reduction in the “near term.” The market took the signal and now assigns more than a 90% chance to a move next week.

That growing division has been exacerbated by the lack of fresh economic data due to a government shutdown that spanned much of October and November. The latest inflation number now in policymakers’ hands, released on Dec. 5, is for September — a report that is unlikely to alter the policy debate.

The Fed delivered a second straight reduction in October driven by the summer’s sudden deterioration in the US labor market. But that was followed by an outburst of hawkish concern from some officials, including five who vote on policy this year, signaling hesitancy or unwillingness to support a third move in December.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to push through another quarter-point interest-rate cut this week despite growing unease among fellow policymakers that inflation remains too high.

In contrast to the Fed, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep its rate steady at 2.25%. Officials have said that’s “about the right level” as long as economic and inflation forecasts materialize.

While third-quarter growth blew past expectations, that was largely driven by lower imports and a jump in military spending, while household consumption declined. Inflation is close to target at 2.2%, though core measures remain elevated.

Elsewhere, central bank decisions from Australia to Switzerland to Brazil will draw attention, and euro-area finance chiefs are scheduled to elect a new chair.

Asia

The week in Asia kicks off with economists expecting Japan to revise third-quarter gross domestic product to show a deeper contraction after recent capital spending data for the period were weak, in a report that will justify the government’s large fiscal stimulus package unveiled last month.

Also Monday, data for October may show real wages falling for a 10th month, underscoring how steady gains in nominal pay aren’t keeping up with inflation.

Data Wednesday are expected to show a modest improvement for China’s price environment in November, with inflation ticking up to 0.7%, the fastest advance since February 2024.

Factory-gate prices are seen falling 2%, in what would be the slowest decline in 15 months. Still, as the CPI got a holiday boost that will likely fade, the figures may prompt Beijing to enact more anti-involution policies to curb price competition.

India also may show a pickup in inflation on Friday, with consumer price gains estimated to have accelerated to 0.75% in November, still well below the Reserve Bank’s 2%-6% target range.

Australia releases the NAB Business Confidence index for November Wednesday and a blast of labor statistics on Thursday that will show if jobs data stayed strong after robust results in October.

New Zealand’s manufacturing PMI gauge may have remained in expansionary territory for a fifth month in November. Trade data are due during the week from China and Taiwan.

In central banks, the Reserve Bank of Australia is seen holding its cash rate steady at 3.6% on Tuesday, extending a pause after three cuts earlier this year.

Focus will be on any signaling that the easing cycle may have run its course, with pricing in the swaps market already mostly reflecting expectations for a hike by September.

In the Philippines, authorities are likely to continue their easing campaign with a cut to the overnight borrowing rate to 4.5% on Thursday.

The Swiss National Bank will draw the spotlight among a series of monetary decisions in the region on Thursday. The outcome will showcase the tradeoff for officials trying to avoid a return to negative borrowing costs in Switzerland.

The central bank is widely expected to keep its rate at zero, but may acknowledge a weaker price outlook after every inflation reading since the last quarterly decision turned out weaker than expected, weighed down by the strength of the franc.

By contrast, Turkish policymakers may cut borrowing costs by as much as 150 basis points in its own final decision of 2025. Growth has slowed more than expected and the latest inflation reading there was lower than any estimate in a Bloomberg survey.

In Serbia, the central bank may extend its rate pause to a fifth quarter as US sanctions shut down the nation’s only refiner, risking a rise in energy prices. And Ukrainian officials will announce their own policy decision after keeping borrowing costs steady for 5 months.

Among data highlights, the UK’s monthly growth number on Friday will focus investors. GDP is predicted by economists to have increased slightly at the start of the fourth quarter, in the last such data release before the Bank of England’s decision. Meanwhile Norwegian inflation is scheduled for Tuesday.

Turning to the euro zone, industrial production numbers in Germany on Monday and Italy on Wednesday will reveal whether manufacturing began staging any sort of recovery at the start of a quarter that officials are hoping will mark a turning point.

Among European Central Bank speakers scheduled are President Christine Lagarde at an event on Wednesday. A blackout period will begin the following day in advance of the monetary decision just over a week later.

In France, the country’s fiscal woes will return to the fore on Tuesday, with a National Assembly vote on social security scheduled for Tuesday. Premier Sebastien Lecornu pulled off a win last week by clinching agreement over the revenue part of that measure.

And euro-zone finance ministers will select one of their own to chair meetings and represent them collectively after the abrupt departure of Ireland’s Paschal Donohoe. Belgium’s Vincent van Peteghem and Greece’s Kyriakos Pierrakakis will face off in a vote when the group meets on Thursday.

Mexico’s monthly inflation data will likely see both headline and core readings creep back up from the current 3.57% and 4.28% respectively.

While both are above policymakers’ 3% target ahead of Banxico’s Dec. 18 rate decision, most Mexico watchers expect the lurking threat of recession to win the case for a 12th straight rate cut.

Brazil’s market readout from the central bank may see some additional improvement in inflation expectations for this year and next ahead of Wednesday’s November consumer prices report and rate decision.

The headline reading for last month posted early Wednesday is very likely to have slowed for a second month, and very possibly below the 4.5% top of policymakers’ tolerance range though still well over the 3% target.

Hours later, there’s almost no chance that Banco Central do Brasil does anything but hold at 15% for a fourth meeting, but the odds are much better for some substantive guidance from bank chief Gabriel Galipolo and colleagues.

President Javier Milei’s long slog to bring Argentine inflation to heel continues this week, with the November monthly print expected to slow from October’s 2.3% reading, bringing the annual rate within hailing distance of 30%.

Peruvian central bankers can take a bow for the lowest inflation rate among LatAm’s major economies but won’t likely take that for granted at December’s monetary policy meeting Thursday.

Caution likely has bank chief Julio Velarde and his board keeping the key rate at 4.25% for a third meeting.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called out slow bureaucracy in Europe in a warning that a “weak” continent poses a major economic risk to the US.

“Europe has a real problem,” Dimon said Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum. “They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”

Most Read from Bloomberg

While he praised some European leaders who he said were aware of the issues, he cautioned politics is “really hard.”

Dimon, leader of the biggest US bank, has long said that the risk of a fragmented Europe is among the major challenges facing the world. In his letter to shareholders released earlier this year, he said that Europe has “some serious issues to fix.”

On Saturday, he praised the creation of the euro and Europe’s push for peace. But he warned that a reduction in military efforts and challenges trying to reach agreement within the European Union are threatening the continent.

“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore,” Dimon said. “It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important.”

He said the US should help.

“We need a long-term strategy to help them become strong,” Dimon said. “A weak Europe is bad for us.”

The administration of President Donald Trump issued a new national security strategy that directed US interests toward the Western Hemisphere and protection of the homeland while dismissing Europe as a continent headed toward “civilizational erasure.”

JPMorgan has been ramping up its push to spur more investments in the national defense sector. In October, the bank announced that it would funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next 10 years — as much as $500 billion more than what it would’ve provided anyway.

Dimon said in the statement that it’s “painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing.”

Investment banker Jay Horine oversees the effort, which Dimon called “100% commercial.” It will focus on four areas: supply chain and advanced manufacturing; defense and aerospace; energy independence and resilience; and frontier and strategic technologies.","['Katherine Chiglinsky', 'Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Is it time to ‘refound’ your startup?,"Sometimes, founding a startup just once isn’t enough.

At least, that seems to be the case with companies like Airtable, Handshake, and Opendoor, which all announced in recent months that they are “refounding.” As reported in The New York Times these announcements are usually tied to new business models or the launch of new AI products.

For example, Airtable said in June that “instead of just adding more A.I. capabilities to our existing platform, we treated this as a refounding moment for the company.

The startup’s co-founder and CEO Howie Liu told the NYT that this is not a pivot because it’s not about changing direction after getting something wrong. Liu said the company considered calling it a relaunch or transformation, but ultimately chose “the language of founding because the stakes feel the same.”

Similarly, Handshake’s chief marketing officer Katherine Kelly said the company is trying to bring startup culture “back into an existing business.” That can also mean harder work — Kelly said handshake told employees they have to be back in the office five days a week, “operating with a pace and number of hours that is meaningful and will help us hit goals.”","['Anthony Ha', 'Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"

Some of the firmest opposition has come from the Writers Guild of America, which issued a statement declaring, “This merger must be blocked.”

“The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the WGA said. “The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers.”

While statements from other Hollywood unions were not quite as unequivocal, they still suggested that there are “many serious questions” about the acquisition’s “impact on the future of the entertainment industry” (as the actors union SAG-AFTRA put it).

The deal came after a competitive process in which Paramount and Comcast also made bids. Paramount was trying to acquire the entire company, while Netflix will only buy the film and television studios, as well as the streaming business, after Warner Bros. moves forward with a plan to spin off its TV networks division.

Initially, Paramount was seen as the frontrunner, with its ties to the Trump administration (the studio is now run by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison) easing the way for regulatory approval. But even before the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount’s lawyers sent an angry letter complaining about “a tilted and unfair process,” and Netflix soon emerged publicly as the winner.

This deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2026, would presumably face significant regulatory scrutiny, and not just from Trump appointees. Senator Elizabeth Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts and longtime critic of Big Tech — put out a statement of her own describing the deal as “an anti-monopoly nightmare.”

“A Netflix-Warner Bros. [merger] would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,” Warren said.

She also argued that antitrust enforcement — including the review process for this deal — must be conducted “fairly and transparently” rather than used to “invite influence-peddling and bribery.”","['Anthony Ha', 'Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"

So, let's get right into this report, Joel. So, mortgage rates, you say here, expected to stay above 6% in 2026. Your forecast, Joel, if I have this right, is 6.3% average mortgage rates next year. Let's start there, Joel. Why, why do they stay above 6% Joel, and what does that mean for affordability next year?

00:24 Joel

Really, we see 2026 as a year of steadying across a lot of dimensions of the housing market. Mortgage rates are one piece of that. Uh we expect uh the the Federal Reserve's cuts in December to already be priced into the market, and we expect stability going forward with how uh monetary policy is handled and how the housing market responds. And so I think this mortgage rate stability is really welcome news for folks who have been on the sidelines for the last couple years, unsure of whether they can get into the market or not because of how volatile rates have been. So we expect 6.3% average throughout 2026 and ending the year at 6.3%.

01:00 Speaker A

And affordability, it improves, Joel, you think, so I have this right because you think incomes will rise faster than prices?

01:10 Joel

That's right. We project prices of homes to rise at about 2.2% over 2026, uh which we think is going to be a little bit below inflation and a little bit below income. So real and adjusted price of homes uh will actually improve a little bit in 2026 and the improvements in mortgage rates from this year's average, which is about 6.6%, play a part in there as well.

01:33 Speaker A

Home sales, you point out here, they hit a 30-year low in 2024. You think they improved slightly this year per your forecast. What happens in 2026, Joel?

01:43 Joel

2026 we're projecting a 1.7% increase in home sales, uh getting up into the 4.1 million range. Uh still pretty subdued from what a couple years ago were, uh but not down to the 30-year lows that we've been seeing uh in 2024 and 2025. So really it's a little bit more of the same, just slightly steadying and a modest improvement in home sales volume.

02:00 Speaker A

What about inventory, Joel? I'm curious what you forecast next year. Are are buyers going to have more options?

02:07 Joel

Buyers will have more options. Across the country, we project an 8.9% increase in the number of homes for sale. And this of course isn't uniform across the country. In different pockets and different markets, we'll see inventory rising and falling at different rates. But overall, uh more options for buyers to choose from, uh less competition. So, uh more negotiating power for buyers.

02:29 Speaker A

You point out, I mean, there are regional differences. Are there certain regions of the country, Joel, you all expect to to outperform next year?

02:38 Joel

A lot of our strongest markets are in the Northeast and Midwest uh in terms of projections for 2026. You know, these are places where we expect sales volume to grow and prices to grow uh because inventory is more constrained. While in the South and West, inventory recovery has been a lot stronger. There's more new construction activity. and so more competition among sellers will keep prices a little bit more uh affordable and attainable while in the Northeast and Midwest, uh we expect more growth.

03:00 Speaker A

Yeah, so so some improvement next year, but what are what are the factors, Joel, the biggest factors that you think would be holding the housing market back? I mean, would it be, you know, is it rates? Is it prices, the economy? Walk me through it.

03:11 Joel

Rates and prices are for sure uh to blame in terms of what's holding the the housing market back this year. But really, I think uncertainty surrounding the economy in general is really holding people on the sidelines. You know, people who are worried about their jobs are not looking to make giant purchases like a new home. And so I think anything that can be done to uh assuage those fears and build up consumer confidence will really go a long way in boo boosting the housing market in 2026.

03:36 Speaker A

A question for for those who rent, Joel, and maybe watching this. You say rents expected to decline slightly by 1% next year, you say. You know, a question that that's sort of asked Joel, is renting more financially attractive than buying? You'll hear that put out there, that's a discussion point. As an economist, how do you try and think through that? What are the variables?

03:59 Joel

The most important things to think about are the time horizon and whether you consider being able to live in your investment valuable or not. Uh based on our price projections, you know, that uh putting money into the S&P and renting might be a good way to get returns on your investment. Uh but getting your foot in the door for home ownership is important for renters too. It's been especially difficult for first time time home buyers in recent years with mortgage rates remaining high. Uh those who don't have equity from an existing home have to save up what they can from their paychecks to make a down payment on their very first home and that's been a challenge. So I certainly don't blame anyone who decides that renting is the right thing for them right now. Um but this should be another year of rent declines and a good time to save up uh for a down payment in the future if that's what your goals are.

04:48 Speaker A

Finally, Joel, just talk to me about the role the Fed plays here. The expectation is, you know, the cuts continue. How does that play into your forecast?

04:55 Joel

Right, our forecast is mostly built on uh economic in inputs um like uh GDP for the various locales that we look at uh in terms of employment, uh because the labor market always underpins the housing market. Uh but the Federal Reserve is something that we keep an eye on, uh how they're behaving and what we expect out of them. Uh like we said uh a little bit earlier uh on the show that uh the the December rate cut uh is pretty well priced in already. Uh but we're interested to see what uh the chairman and the FOMC has to say about the longer-term projections for rate cuts and whether those will give mortgage rates room to even get below our projections. You know, we're we're in the business of selling home, so we'd love to see those rates come down.","['Wed', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt']"

1 to 4% we just talked about how Bank of America is now that those are their allocation parameters. How does that sound to you in terms of where how people should think about Bitcoin in their portfolio or crypto in theirportfolio?

0:13 spk_1

This is the standard allocation recommendation from Wall Street these days, which is, as we just heard, land breaking. I mean this is this is.Huge. The fact that major Wall Street firms are now saying everybody should own at least some Bitcoin, typically single digits, low single digits. My attitude is put a 0 on both of those numbers. You should have at least 10%, not 1, up to 40% of the portfolio, not just 4, and it's because this represents theSingle best investment opportunity for the next decade. We know how wonderful it's been in the past 16 years. This trend is going to continue as we see greater and greater adoption. Just look at Bank of America with its 15,000 financial advisors. Look at Vanguard with its 150 million customer accounts. If suddenly all of these trillions of dollars of portfolio holdings.Begin to allocate 2%. We're talking about tens of billions of dollars of flows going into Bitcoin, which is a fixed supply. This has to translate to major price increases. OK,

1:14 spk_0

over time, if that's the case though, and this is a trend that already has begun, why do we still see such volatility? Shouldn't that have dampened the volatility? Why are we, why do we still see thishuge

1:25 spk_1

drawdown? It has dampened the volatility. Exactly right. If what is goingOn the last 6 weeks occurred 3 years ago. Bitcoin would be down 80%. It's not. It's only, I'll put that in quotes, only down 30%, because while there's massive deleveraging, a lot of selling, a lot of the Bitcoin whales from a decade ago, liquidating to create liquidity for themselves now that they're multibillionaires, while all the selling is going on, there is simultaneously massive institutional buying which is helping to provide the floor, which is why Bitcoin.Hasn't dropped 80%. It's only been 30%.

1:58 spk_0

Rick. This gets a sort of fundamental sort of philosophical shift to me in the way that people invest in anything, which is that typically if you're investing for retirement, you want something that is going to provide a modest cushion for you. I feel like now there has been this shift into investing both in stocks and in crypto to make you rich.Is that the right way though to look at this situation? Isn't that highly risky if you're depending on it to make you rich?

2:29 spk_1

I, I agree with the premise, but I'd use a different phrase. Instead of saying make me rich, I would put it in the context of make sure my money lasts as long as I do, and it's because people are recognizing longevity. We're seeing the likelihood that.If you're alive today, odds are pretty good you're gonna live to 90, 100, 105. You're not gonna be dead at 85 the way our parents, grandparents, great grandparents were, and that means my money's gonna have to last as long as I do. And if I leave the money in bank accounts, T bills, money markets, CDs, bonds, I'm not going to get the after tax after inflation rate of return.I need to keep my money growing so that it can generate the income I need. So do I need to get rich, rich enough so I never run out of? I mean,

3:14 spk_0

maybethe competition isn't money market funds. Maybe it's just a regular vanilla index fund that you reinvest dividends.

3:21 spk_1

Absolutely right. And therefore we need to recognize the mantra is always has been and always will be diversification. So we recognize that crypto is simply another.Sleeve in the crypto asset class is a pretty big sleeve for an aggressive investor for sure, and most are never going to go near that, but my point is a 1 or 2% allocation if you're really trying to have a diversified approach and a rebalancing modern portfolio theory approach, 1 or 2% is not going to cut it. You need 5 or 10%, and that's what.Beginning to see advisers recommending it isn't the 1 to 4, it's more like 5 to 10.

3:59 spk_0

Are there any risks that you're concerned about?

4:02 spk_1

Always, which is why it's only 5 or 10% of the portfolio. The biggest risk to me is investor behavior is that they were totally excited, a little too enthusiastic when Bitcoin was 125,000, and they're a little too pessimistic when Bitcoin is 85,000. It's investor psychology which is always the biggest challenge.","['Tue', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt']"

We got to get to what investors want to know about their portfolios, and I've got a nice little list here. Let's just briefly review tax loss harvesting. You can, if you have a security or a stock that you own right now, you can actually sell it and then you can take that loss and possibly offset your tax bill for next year, but you've got to be careful not to buy it back for 30 days. Any thoughts on that? Right?

0:22 spk_1

So, it's something that as a wealth manager, an asset manager, that's what you do, right? You should take advantage.So individual investors should take a look at their portfolio and take advantage of any loss. And if you want to take a gain, you're gonna take this loss, write it off against the gain, uh, and then reallocate some of that money into either a new sector or like Jared said, you're gonna wait 30, 31 days and then reinvest it if you like the name that you sold. All right,

0:45 spk_0

now let's talk about rebalancing and reassessing portfolio risk because that's what investors should be focused on right now.

0:51 spk_1

Right. So you really have to take a look at the portfolio.And you have to see whether you're out of balance right in terms of have prices have stocks gone up in value that they've now created a portfolio that's not in balance or at least not in balance the way that you want it to be. So you should always look to, uh, to, to fix that. Now it doesn't mean you have to sell something the way I do it is I add new money to the sectors that are now underweight and then I bring the whole thing back into balance again. So you could do it a couple of ways, that's just the way I do it.

1:17 spk_0

All right, now let's talk about risk tolerance and time.Horizon very key concepts that we talk about in trading and investing here. I know you spent a lot of time on this, so break it down for us.

1:27 spk_1

So you really want to talk about time horizon, who you are and who the money is for. You might be in your 60s or 70s, yet the money we're talking about is for children or grandchildren that might be out 1520, or 25 years. And so it should take on a different risk profile than if it were for you at that stage in your life. That being said, you should also be aware.Of the of the of the score, the risk score of not only the portfolio but the individual names within the portfolio because every stock, every ETF has its own risk score from 1 to 99. Anything above 71 is further out of the is beyond the S&P in terms of risk, right? It gets riskier than the S&P 500. Anything less than 71 becomes more conservative. So you just need to understand how the different names in the portfolio interact to give you anOverall score

2:14 spk_0

and also something key here, some older investors might need cash flow and so that comes into dividend needs, cash needs, and that's something to start thinking about for quarter for the firstquarter. Yeah,

2:26 spk_1

of course it should be something that you're always thinking about again depending on who you are and where you are in the life cycle, right? Right now, you know, you might be 60 but fully employed and you're not looking for dividend income. You're not looking for the for the portfolio to generate income you're going to take, so you.And then you want to have it reinvested. If you're even take, if you have a portfolio that generating a lot of income, you just want to reinvest it. If it's income you need or want, then you should figure out, you know, what it's going to spin off. You, you, you can expect to spend 4% of your portfolio and never run out of money, so a million dollars portfolio would, would, would, you'd take out $40,000 a year. So you'd want to get dividends that would pay about $40,000 a year and then that could go on forever and you'd never run out of money.","['Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt']"

The lesson is to look at the ecosystem, the same way OpenAI does. Who owns the chips that train these models? Who runs the data centers that power them? Who secures the networks that protect them?

Who builds the applications that sit on top?

""The new tariffs could increase builder costs anywhere from $7,500 to $10,000 per home,"" Rob Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders told CNBC, citing estimates from U.S. homebuilders. Last year, the NAHB estimated that every $1,000 increase in the median price of a new home prices out roughly 106,000 potential buyers.

So far, the biggest impact has been felt in lumber prices, ""which are expected to total about $4,900 per home on average, according to Leading Builders of America, the trade group representing most of the nation’s publicly traded homebuilders,"" the website shared.

While the United States does produce some lumber, about a third of all the wood purchased for homebuilding comes from Canada. Domestic lumber producers generally raise their prices to match import prices.

Rising lumber prices damage the entire home construction industry, and a lack of certainty adds complexity to the home-building process, Steve Martinez, president of Tradewinds General Contracting in Boise, Idaho, shared with the NAHB.

“Our contracts are all fixed price — meaning that from the time we bid a project to the time we start to the time we order the materials, prices could change drastically,” Martinez explained. “But we are trying to preorder as much material as we can.”

While rising and volatile prices impact major players like Home Depot, they are better able to mitigate and predict the impact than smaller retailers.

Instead, prosecutors say he spent it on Rolls-Royces, a Ferrari, and wildly expensive mattresses","Carl Erik Rinsch had already burned through more than $44 million of Netflix’s money when the streaming giant wired him an additional $11 million in March 2020 to finish a sci-fi series called “White Horse.” But according to the federal indictment, the show was never completed. And not a single episode aired.

Instead, federal prosecutors say Rinsch diverted nearly all those funds into personal brokerage accounts, lost half of it on speculative stock trades, made it back through cryptocurrency, and then went on a massive shopping spree that included five Rolls-Royces, one Ferrari, and two handcrafted Swedish mattresses that together cost $638,000.​

Rinsch, 48, attended his trial in a Manhattan federal courtroom early Tuesday, facing charges of wire fraud, money laundering, and unlawful monetary transactions that carry a combined maximum penalty of 90 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and declined to discuss a plea deal. His lead attorney, Daniel Adam McGuinness, did not immediately respond to Fortune‘s request for comment, but he previously told Business Insider, “Mr. Rinsch is looking forward to the opportunity to show that these charges are not founded and that he’s completely innocent.”

​The ‘White Horse’ that never was

In 2018, Netflix outbid Amazon, HBO, Apple, and others to secure “White Horse”—later renamed “Conquest”—a dystopian thriller about an artificial humanlike species. Actor Keanu Reeves, who had starred in Rinsch’s only feature film, the 2013 box-office bomb “47 Ronin,” served as an early investor and mentor on the project. According to The New York Times, Netflix agreed to pay $61.2 million for rights to the series, and it also granted Rinsch something it had only previously given a handful of directors: final cut. In other words, he’d have the last word on the version of his show that would air.​

But production hit problems almost immediately. Rinsch exceeded budgets during shoots in Brazil, Uruguay, and Hungary, and by December 2019, filming had stalled with no episodes completed. Netflix executives agreed to provide the additional $11 million in hopes of salvaging the project, according to court documents.​

Instead, prosecutors allege, Rinsch transferred almost all of the $11 million into his personal brokerage account within weeks of receiving it, losing more than half through speculative options trades on a biopharmaceutical company and an S&P 500 ETF—all while telling then-Netflix executive CIndy Holland the project was going “awesome” and “game changing good.” He later invested the remaining funds in cryptocurrency and generated roughly $10 million in gains, which prosecutors say he spent on luxury goods, credit card debt, divorce attorneys, and legal fees incurred in suing Netflix for additional payments.​","['Dave Smith', 'Wed', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Fidelity customers lose 401(k) access. Some call it a 'mind-boggling' power grab. But the company says it's about safety,"For its part, a Fidelity spokesperson told InvestmentNews that they only block online access and that a direct call with a company rep will help customers restore it (3).

One example is Phoenix resident Kelly Havins, 63, who told The New York Times that he enlisted a Pontera financial advisor because, when it comes to managing his 401(k), he doesn’t “have the time or the understanding” (2). He said that when Fidelity contacted him to warn that he could be locked out of his account, he “thought it was a scam.” But it wasn’t, and, after some back and forth with Fidelity, he lost online access to his account. Havins said he had to work with his financial advisor to regain access.

As a result, they warned that they would “prevent platforms reliant on credential sharing from accessing and taking action in customer accounts”. Now, customers who employed third-party platforms like Pontera are being locked out of their own Fidelity retirement accounts.

Back in September 2024, Fidelity released a statement expressing concerns about the dangers of “credential sharing … particularly when it enables third parties to take high-risk actions, such as executing trades within the accounts” (1).

Pontera allows financial advisors to access a client’s 401(k) account, like those held with Fidelity, through their platform while protecting the client’s personal login credentials. That way, advisors can safely manage the account while being restrained by the platform from gaining control over actions such as transferring a client’s funds without authorization.

Protect your retirement accounts

In spite of Havins’ experience, financial fraud is indeed common and something that Americans should watch out for when it comes to their retirement accounts.

In fact, according to Planadviser, “retirement plans’ unique business model creates multiple potential openings for breaches… participants’ contributions and data often move through multiple organizations before reaching the financial institution serving as plan custodian” (5).

The debate over access and customer safety

In an open letter posted to their website on Oct. 10, Pontera framed the situation as a “battle” between one side that stands for “consumer choice” and another that is “an entrenched institutional incumbent highly conflicted and motivated by their own economics” (6). They labelled Fidelity’s actions an “anticompetitive power grab,” accusing them of compelling clients to use their own in-house financial advisors. As well, they classified those same clients as “captives … lacking the ability to move their money elsewhere” as a 401(k) is tied to an employer, and it’s the latter who decides what investment company they use.

A Fidelity spokesperson told USA Today they do in fact “work closely to support” independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) who “securely advise on employer-sponsored retirement accounts with plan sponsor oversight” (7).

Brenden Gebben, CEO of Absolute Capital, also spoke with USA Today and said that his company has an agreement with Fidelity to advise on behalf of their clients, adding that “We are a regulated entity"" and noted Pontera is unregulated from a financial perspective.

Meanwhile, financial planner Ben Henry-Moreland said in an interview with InvestmentNews that Pontera and similar third-party platforms “use 'screen scraping' technology that gives them access to a lot more client information than what's needed for the tool to perform its function” (8). He warned that such data could potentially be sold without the client’s permission, but did say that “it's frustrating that Fidelity, if reporting is true, hasn't worked with Pontera” to create a more secure connection between them.

To that end, Pontera told The New York Times that they tried to work with Fidelity to customize secure access to customer investment accounts, but didn’t hear back.

Weighing the benefits of a financial advisor

The ongoing struggle between Fidelity and Pontera does raise the point that many Americans would prefer to choose their own financial advisor when it comes to handling their 401(k) accounts.

The advantages of a financial advisor are clear: personalized advice based solely on your own needs and desires, as well as a trusted professional to answer questions, explain your investment options and warn of risks you might not see coming.

That said, as Kiplinger notes, financial advisors have to get paid, too, and they “typically charge an annual fee based on a percentage of the assets they manage,” often somewhere between 0.5% and 1.5% (9). Still, the outlet adds that “the personalized advice and improved performance they can provide may outweigh the cost of their fees over time.”

It’s also a good idea to weigh your need for an advisor. Ask yourself, are your account management needs complicated enough to necessitate outside help? If so, make sure to enlist a fiduciary investment advisor to look out for your financial needs. Fiduciaries, by law, must act solely in your own best interest when managing your accounts.

If you find that you do need a financial advisor, it can be challenging to find the right expert for your unique situation. You could rely on a word-of-mouth referral from a friend or a colleague, or you could do your own homework — all in one place.

Advisor.com can help you find a professional financial advisor who has expertise in your problem area — and it takes just two minutes.

It’s simple to use: Just answer a few quick questions about yourself and your finances, then the platform will match you with up to three experienced fiduciary financial professionals to help you review your investments and retirement accounts, and develop a plan to achieve your retirement goals.

You can view the advisors’ profiles, read past client reviews and schedule an initial consultation for free with no obligation to hire.

Forbes notes that an advisor can take multiple separate accounts and employ “a portfolio-based approach [that] focuses on achieving the target asset mix when all accounts are combined (10).” The publication adds that your 401(k) may also need to be rebalanced regularly to ensure it’s working toward your retirement goals.

I don’t really know how it happened, but around $50 from my bank account was withdrawn for alleged service that I did not approve, or see. To make a long story short, I had to block my card, but in the end, my bank refunded the amount.

But not every scam has a happy ending. And today, more people are getting scammed than ever before.

In fact, 73% of U.S. adults confirm to have experienced at least one online scam or attack, and most get scam calls, texts, and emails at least weekly, according to a 2025 survey by Pew Research Center.

“Online scams and other internet crimes are skyrocketing, with a record $16.6 billion in losses reported to the FBI in 2024. The federal government, banks and companies are all sounding alarms,” reads the Pew report.

A number of popular brands are often used by attackers to create phishing scams, and Walmart topped the list in the first quarter of 2023.

List of brands most likely to be used for phishing scams:

Walmart (relating to 16% of all phishing attacks globally)

DHL (13%)

Microsoft (12%)

LinkedIn (6%)

FedEx (4.9%)

Google (4.8%)

Netflix (4%)

Raiffeisen (3.6%)

PayPal (3.5%)

And so it happens that Walmart was targeted in the latest large-scale scam that gained attention from Washington.

The FCC demands cessation of Walmart-impersonation robocalls

On Dec. 2, the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Enforcement Bureau requested that SK Teleco, the voice service provider, immediately stop scam robocalls impersonating Walmart employees.

If the company doesn’t take action to permanently prevent this and similar scam calls from traversing its networks, it risks being cut off from U.S. communications networks, according to FCC’s news release.

What is the Walmart impersonation robocall scam?

Per FCC’s report, the scam was based on AI voices identifying themselves as “Carl” or “Emma,” calling “from Walmart” and claiming there was a preauthorized purchase of PlayStation 5 orders from a person’s Walmart account for an amount of $919.45.

The voice would further guide customers, asking them to press 1 or call back if they want to cancel the order or connect to live operators.

Once consumers are connected to live operators, they would ask them for personal identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers.

“Scammers and thieves using our phone networks to defraud consumers or steal personal data is illegal and voice service providers must be part of the solution. While most providers understand this responsibility, we won’t tolerate those that turn a blind eye and allow shady robocallers on their networks,” stated FCC Chairman Brendan Carr.","['Nina Zdinjak', 'Wed', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,"US housing market poised to crash ‘worse than 2008,’ expert warns. And 50% plunge could start in 2026. Protect yourself","“I believe we could get started in earnest next year on the price decline and see a rather large drop historically speaking, but still think it could take several years to bottom,” she told Newsweek (4).

Wright believes the coming correction could take several years to fully play out, but she thinks the downturn could begin as early as 2026.

There are already hints of a shift. Zillow recently reported that 53% of U.S. homes lost value over the past year — the highest share since 2012 — with an average drawdown of 9.7% (3).

It’s a chilling prospect. Given how much U.S. household wealth sits in home equity — and how much leverage many recent buyers are carrying — a 50% decline would be devastating.

When asked how far prices would need to fall to restore balance, Wright didn’t mince words: “It's going to be near your 50% — and much greater in certain areas (1).”

Realtor.com estimates a typical household now needs to earn roughly $118,530 a year to afford a median-priced home (2). The actual median household income as of 2024, when the latest data was available? Just $83,730 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis. That’s a wide gap.

The disconnect between home prices and household income is striking. According to Federal Reserve data, the median sales price of a U.S. home reached $410,800 in Q2 2025 — a 42% jump over the past decade.

Wright noted that during the last crash, prices were on their way toward that equilibrium — where median incomes and median home values align — but “Wall Street came in to buy those,” effectively stopping the decline. This time, she argues, large investors may not step in.

“I think, Adam, we're going to correct all the way to a point where household median income matches the median home price. And so that is going to be worse than 2008,” she said (1).

In a recent interview with Adam Taggart on “Thoughtful Money,” Wright said the U.S. housing market is heading for a significant correction.

The 2008 housing meltdown was brutal — home values collapsed, millions of Americans were pushed into foreclosure and trillions in household wealth evaporated. Now, housing analyst Melody Wright is warning that the next downturn could be even worse.

Story Continues

She’s not the only one sounding alarms. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said the housing market is already in a “recession” due to Federal Reserve policy (5). And “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki has warned that the “biggest crash in history” is beginning — adding that “residential real estate crashes” in this scenario as well.

If you share these concerns, now may be a good time to start preparing.

A safe haven for ‘bad times’

When storm clouds gather over the markets, gold often reclaims the spotlight.

Long seen as the ultimate safe haven, gold isn’t tied to any single country, currency or economy. It can’t be created at will by central banks like fiat money and in times of economic turmoil, market turbulence or geopolitical uncertainty, investors tend to pile in — driving up its value.

Over the past 12 months, gold prices have surged by more than 50%.

Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, has repeatedly emphasized gold’s importance in a resilient portfolio.

“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” he told CNBC earlier this year. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier.”

One way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.

Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.

Build a safety net

The 2008 housing crash didn’t just wipe out home equity — it rippled through the entire economy. Layoffs mounted, the unemployment rate spiked and families across the country found themselves suddenly vulnerable. If another major correction is coming, it’s worth strengthening your safety net before the ripple effects hit.

One of the most effective ways to do that is by having a cushion of readily accessible cash. If your income suddenly takes a hit, that buffer helps you stay afloat without taking on costly debt or being forced to sell investments at the worst possible time.

So how big should that safety net be?

Personal finance expert Dave Ramsey suggests having an emergency fund that can cover three to six months worth of living expenses. What matters most, though, is consistency — adding a little at a time until your safety net starts to take shape.

To get started, a high-yield account, such as a Wealthfront Cash Account, can be a great place to grow your emergency fund, offering both competitive interest rates and easy access to your cash when you need it.

A Wealthfront Cash Account can provide a base variable APY of 3.50%, but Moneywise readers can get an exclusive 0.65% boost over their first three months for a total APY of 4.15% provided by program banks on your uninvested cash. That’s over nine times the national deposit savings rate, according to the FDIC’s September report.

With no minimum balances or account fees, as well as 24/7 withdrawals and free domestic wire transfers, you can ensure your funds remain accessible at all times. Plus, Wealthfront Cash Account balances of up to $8 million are insured by the FDIC through program banks.

Get expert guidance

At the end of the day, everyone’s financial situation is different — from income levels and investment goals to debt obligations and risk tolerance. And when the economic outlook is uncertain, those differences matter even more. If you’re unsure where to start, now could be the right time to get in touch with a financial advisor.

With Vanguard, you can connect with a personal advisor who can help assess how you’re doing so far and make sure you've got the right portfolio to meet your goals on time.

Vanguard’s hybrid advisory system combines advice from professional advisers and automated portfolio management to make sure your investments are working to achieve your financial goals.

Read our full review of the Prime Visa card.

Why we like the Prime Visa for holiday shopping

The Prime Visa card is a great cash-back credit card and an ideal choice for Amazon shoppers.

You will need an Amazon Prime membership for this card. If you’re not already a member, the Prime Visa’s rewards can help you more than make up the cost (around $14.99 per month) if you purchase with Amazon often. Amazon shoppers with a Prime membership, on the other hand, won’t pay any additional fee.

Over the holidays, your Prime Visa card can help you secure up to 5% savings on your Amazon shopping — in addition to Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. Plus, the $250 welcome gift card alone can go a long way in helping you check off your holiday gift lists.

Your Prime Visa card can also be useful for grocery shopping, big holiday dinners and parties. While you won’t be able to use your welcome gift card at Whole Foods, you will earn 5% cash back on Whole Foods purchases, which can include everything from a Thanksgiving turkey and cranberry sauce to bakery goods for your holiday guests.

And don’t forget about the everyday essentials you’ll still need to cover amid those holiday additions to your budget. You can use your Prime Visa to earn 5% cash back on those necessities from Amazon too, including cleaning supplies, personal hygiene products, and pantry staples.

Amazon Cyber Monday shopping 2025

You no longer have to wait until the weekend after Thanksgiving to start scoring holiday discounts on Amazon. Today, you’ll find early Black Friday deals on the site ranging from appliances and tech to beauty products, clothing, books, and more.

For example, you can get a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL for $899 on Amazon now, which is 25% off its original list price of $1,199.

If you open a new Prime Visa and get the $250 welcome gift card, you could bring the effective price down to $649. You’ll also earn 5% back on your purchase — at $649, that’s more than $32 in added cash back rewards. In total, combining your Prime Visa savings with this limited-time deal could lower the amount you pay for a new phone from $1,199 to around $617.

Another great deal available right now is the Shark Upright Vacuum, which is currently $119 — a $100 discount from its original list price of $219. If you use your Prime Visa welcome gift card, you could cover this purchase and still have $131 of the $250 left for additional holiday savings.

Or maybe you want to get ahead of some gifts for kids. Plenty of toys are discounted by 40% or more already, including a Peppa Pig playhouse for toddlers (49% off), plush Barney toys (40% off), and an Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids tablet (45% off). With any of these limited-time deals, you can use your $250 welcome gift card to cover the full cost and still have cash left for additional gifts.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Why driverless tractor trailers are coming sooner than you think,"Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid Unfiltered on Apple Podcasts, Amazon Music, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.

Driverless trucking has entered the man vs. machine debate.

And Aurora Innovation (AUR) co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson is one true believer.

“Fifty years from now, people are going to wonder: Did we really let people drive cars on the road?” he told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on a new episode of the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast. (see the video above or listen below.)

This embedded content is not available in your region.

Urmson is a long-standing innovator in driverless vehicles. He worked with Google's (GOOG) autonomous vehicle upstart Waymo and founded Aurora in 2017.

The self-driving freight startup is now pushing for driverless 18-wheelers. “Our technology is the combination of the software and hardware that allows that truck to get where it needs to go on the road every day safely,” he said.

Urmson also understands that some skepticism about the safety of driverless vehicles is warranted. “We’ve got something like four and a half million tests that we push the system through before we ever let it go driverless on the road,” he said.

Safety includes keeping systems away from vulnerability to hackers, as well as devising mechanisms that react quickly in the event of a possible fender bender.

The company’s updated LiDAR technology, called First Light LiDAR, “can see things 11 seconds before you could with conventional LiDAR,” he said. “That means we can react more quickly and earlier.""

Industry-wide, a rousing debate continues over a trucker shortage. On some sides, observers claim that it’s not as intense as it’s made to sound, while others proclaim the sector is in dire straits.

In October, a Newsweek article reported that 69% of freight businesses struggled to meet trucking demands. Challenges included high staffing turnover rates and tariffs, which rose by as much as 25% on heavy trucks. Over 30 trucking companies had filed for Chapter 11 in a short span of time, according to the article.

Aurora reported its third quarter results in October, which included a loss of $0.11 per share, compared to a loss of $0.13 per share a year prior.

Even so, the use of technology as a problem solver remains at the forefront of Urmson’s mission.

Aurora has vehicles making trips along the country’s “southern smile,” according to Urmson, and the company is working with major players including FedEx, Nvidia, Uber, and Uber Freight.

Rather than take jobs, Urmson foresees an industry where 450,000 new jobs in the US could be created over the coming 15 years. Driverless trucks could assist with “big, long-haul things where people have to spend time away from their family,” giving human drivers the shorter trip option.","['Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"

According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has risen by 13 basis points to 6.10%, and the 15-year fixed rate is up 14 basis points to 5.55%.

These increases can likely be attributed to the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, which was released yesterday. The PCE index showed that inflation has mostly moved as expected. While that isn't necessarily bad news, it does give reason to believe the Federal Reserve won't be more assertive about its rate cuts in early 2026. Mortgage rates will probably remain relatively flat for at least several months, so if you're ready to buy a house, now could be as good a time as six months from now.

Today's mortgage rates

Here are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:

30-year fixed: 6.10%

20-year fixed: 5.97%

15-year fixed: 5.55%

5/1 ARM: 6.45%

7/1 ARM: 6.38%

30-year VA: 5.56%

15-year VA: 5.22%

5/1 VA: 5.40%

30-year fixed mortgage rates: Pros and cons

There are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.

A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.

The main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.

A 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much more in interest over the life of your loan due to both the higher rate and the longer term.

15-year fixed mortgage rates: Pros and cons

The pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped with those of the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.

However, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.

Adjustable mortgage rates: Pros and cons

Adjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.

The main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)

With an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.

But if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.

Is now a good time to buy a house?

First of all, now is a relatively good time to buy a house compared to a couple of years ago. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current housing market.

Although mortgage rates are up today, rates have been trending downward overall. The average 30-year rate on a conventional loan has dropped by more than a half-point since the beginning of 2025.

The best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you.

Today's mortgage rates: FAQs

What is a 30-year mortgage rate right now?

According to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.10% right now. But keep in mind that mortgage rates vary by state and even ZIP code. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.

Are interest rates expected to go down?

Economists don't expect mortgage interest rates to significantly drop before the end of the year. They may inch down here or there, but they probably won't plummet.

Are mortgage rates dropping?

Overall, mortgage rates have dropped gradually. The 30-year fixed rate has dropped by over half a point since January.

How do I get the lowest refinance rate?

In many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.","['Hal Bundrick', 'Cfp', 'Laura Grace Tarpley', 'Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"

The Federal Reserve cut its federal funds rate three times in 2024, and it recently announced its second rate cut of 2025, so now could be your last chance to lock in a competitive CD rate before rates fall further. CD rates vary widely across financial institutions, so it’s important to ensure you’re getting the best rate possible when shopping around for a CD.

The following is a breakdown of CD rates today and where to find the best offers.

Overview of CD rates today

Generally, the best CD rates today are offered on shorter terms of around one year or less. Online banks and credit unions, in particular, offer the top CD rates.

As of December 6, 2025, the highest CD rate is 4.1% APY. This rate is offered by Marcus by Goldman Sachs on its 14-month CD.

Here is a look at some of the best CD rates available today:

This embedded content is not available in your region.

How much interest can I earn with a CD?

The amount of interest you can earn from a CD depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (CD interest typically compounds daily or monthly).

Say you invest $1,000 in a one-year CD with 1.70% APY, and interest compounds monthly. At the end of that year, your balance would grow to $1,017.13 — your initial $1,000 deposit, plus $17.13 in interest.

Now let’s say you choose a one-year CD that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.74 over the same period, which includes $40.74 in interest.

The more you deposit in a CD, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a one-year CD at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance when the CD matures would be $10,407.42, meaning you’d earn $407.42 in interest. ​​

Types of CDs

When choosing a CD, the interest rate is usually top of mind. However, the rate isn’t the only factor you should consider. There are several types of CDs that offer different benefits, though you may need to accept a slightly lower interest rate in exchange for more flexibility. Here’s a look at some of the common types of CDs you can consider beyond traditional CDs:

Bump-up CD : This type of CD allows you to request a higher interest rate if your bank's rates go up during the account’s term. However, you’re usually allowed to ""bump up"" your rate just once.

No-penalty CD : Also known as a liquid CD, type of CD gives you the option to withdraw your funds before maturity without paying a penalty.

Jumbo CD : These CDs require a higher minimum deposit (usually $100,000 or more), and often offer higher interest rate in return. In today’s CD rate environment, however, the difference between traditional and jumbo CD rates may not be much.

Brokered CD: As the name suggests, these CDs are purchased through a brokerage rather than directly from a bank. Brokered CDs can sometimes offer higher rates or more flexible terms, but they also carry more risk and might not be FDIC-insured.","['Casey Bond', 'Sat', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"

What is the downside of a money market account?

Compared to a traditional savings account, a money market account may come with more restrictions.

Although the national average savings interest rate is fairly low compared to other investments, the best savings rates on the market today are much higher. In fact, some of the top accounts are currently offering 4% APY and up.

Today, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4.3% APY. This rate is offered by SoFi.*

Here is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners:

How much interest can I earn with a savings account?

The amount of interest you can earn from a savings account depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (savings account interest typically compounds daily).

Say you put $1,000 in a savings account at the average interest rate of 0.4 % with daily compounding. At the end of one year, your balance would grow to $1,004.01 — your initial $1,000 deposit, plus just $4.01 in interest.

Now let’s say you choose a high-yield savings account that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.81 over the same period, which includes $40.81 in interest.

The more you deposit in a savings account, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a high-yield savings account at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance after one year would be $10,408.08, meaning you’d earn $408.08 in interest. ​​

Flying Blue overview

What is Flying Blue?

Flying Blue is the joint travel loyalty program of Air France and KLM, two European airlines based out of Paris and Amsterdam. This free-to-join program offers members the opportunity to earn and redeem Flying Blue Miles.

Where does Flying Blue fly?

Air France and KLM are the primary airlines within Flying Blue, offering direct flights to numerous destinations worldwide, including North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. These flights are based out of the hub cities of Paris and Amsterdam.

However, Flying Blue also partners with over 30 other airlines to provide access to even more global destinations. For U.S.-based travelers, that includes access to Delta routes to and from these U.S. cities:

Atlanta (ATL)

Boston (BOS)

Charlotte (CLT)

Chicago (ORD)

Dallas (DFW)

Denver (DEN)

Detroit (DTW)

Fort Lauderdale (FLL)

How to earn Flying Blue Miles

Flying

You can earn Flying Blue Miles and status points, called XP, on eligible flights with Air France, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and over 30 partner airlines, including Delta Air Lines.

Credit cards

The Air France KLM World Elite Mastercard® earns Flying Blue Miles on all eligible purchases, doesn’t charge foreign transaction fees, and typically provides a sign-up bonus to qualifying new cardholders. It may make sense to apply for it if you frequently use Flying Blue.

However, it’s worth noting that you can transfer rewards to Flying Blue from most major credit card rewards programs, including American Express Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Capital One, Citi ThankYou Rewards, and Wells Fargo.

That opens up huge opportunities for taking advantage of Flying Blue redemptions while staying within a flexible rewards program.

With that in mind, here are additional travel credit cards you could use to earn (via transfers) Flying Blue Miles:

If you prefer travel cards with premium perks, such as airport lounge access, consider these options:

Related: Best rewards credit cards

Sharing miles

The Flying Blue program lets you create or join a Flying Blue Family with up to eight Flying Blue members, with a maximum of two adults and six children.

A Flying Blue Family lets you share your Flying Blue Miles with other members of the group, making it easier to build your overall points pool and book more award flights.

Buying miles

Flying Blue members can buy more Flying Blue Miles through the Flying Blue website. This typically isn’t the most cost-effective way to earn miles, but it could make sense if you need to top off your balance to make a specific redemption.

Here are a few examples of how much it costs to buy Flying Blue Miles:

2,000 miles: $63.40

10,000 miles: $305

50,000 miles: $1,525

100,000 miles: $3,050

Additional ways to earn Flying Blue Miles

Hotel and other stays: Flying Blue has partnered with hotels and booking websites to offer opportunities to earn miles on hotel and other stays. Some of the partners include Accor Live Limitless, Hyatt, Booking.com, Choice Privileges, Hilton Honors, IHG, and more.

Car rentals: Similarly, you can also earn miles with eligible car rentals from Hertz, Alamo, Enterprise, National, Avis, Budget, and more.

Shopping: The Flying Blue shopping portal, Shop for Miles, lets you earn miles for shopping at popular stores and retailers like Walmart, Macy’s, CVS, and others.

Experiences: The Flying Blue Event & Concert Tickets website allows you to earn miles on various event tickets. If you’re planning to book a fun tour or activity, consider using GetYourGuide to earn miles on your booking (after adding your Flying Blue number).

How to book flights with Flying Blue

1. Sign up for a free Flying Blue account on the Air France or KLM website.

2. Log in to your account on either website.

3. Select the “Book a flight” option to search for flights using cash. Select the “Book with Miles” option to search for flights using miles.

4. Enter your desired itinerary information, including one-way or round trip, your departure city, your arrival city, your date(s), the number of passengers, and the fare class.

5. Select the “Search flights” button and browse flights from the available options.

6. Select a flight from the available options, enter the required personal and payment information, then book your flight.

Tip: If you’re browsing Flying Blue award flights and want to see a monthly calendar view of prices, leave the “Departure date” field blank when you start your search.

Flying Blue award sweet spots and example bookings

There’s loads of value to be had from the Flying Blue program, but you have to play around with it to see how it can benefit you. Here are some examples of what you can expect to find.

Economy flights to/from Europe

You can find economy flights to Europe from the U.S. for as little as 18,750 miles when Flying Blue is running promotional fares.

If there aren’t promotional fares available for the route you’re checking, the lowest economy award tickets tend to run at 25,000 miles.

Business flights to and from Europe

Business class flights to Europe from North America can go as low as 45,000 miles per person on promotional fares.

The typical business class award ticket will go as low as 60,000 miles without a promotional fare.

Delta domestic flights

Delta U.S. domestic flights can provide great value when booking through Flying Blue. This flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas would only cost 5,000 miles one-way.

For a short flight between Atlanta and Miami, you’d be on the hook for 8,000 miles.

Partner international flights

This Delta flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo would only cost 35,500 miles.

This AeroMexico flight from Houston to Mexico City is only 8,500 miles.

Who should care about Flying Blue Miles?

This list can give you an idea of who may be able to make the most of using Flying Blue to earn and redeem miles:

Delta travelers: Flying Blue members can redeem miles toward Delta flights, often at a lower price. Delta elite status can also get you benefits when flying with KLM and Air France, including priority boarding, extra baggage allowance, preferred seats, lounge access, and more.

Families: With a 25% discount on Flying Blue award tickets for children under 12, the Flying Blue program can provide huge value for families.

Europe enthusiasts: Flying Blue is based out of Paris and Amsterdam, making it an excellent choice for travelers who frequently visit Europe. You can fly directly to those cities from many destinations worldwide, or connect through to another city.

Flying Blue tips and tricks

Transfer bonuses

Major credit card rewards programs frequently offer bonuses on transfers to certain travel partners. This means you’ll receive additional miles on top of the miles you would normally get from a transfer.

For example, Amex Membership Rewards typically transfer to Flying Blue at a 1:1 ratio, which means you get 1,000 Flying Blue Miles for every 1,000 Membership Rewards you transfer.

With a 20% transfer bonus, you would actually get 1,200 Flying Blue Miles for every 1,000 Membership Rewards transferred. That may not seem like a lot when talking about only transferring 1,000 points, but it adds up the more points you transfer. And any points you save can be used for more redemptions down the road.

Flying Blue Promo Rewards

Every month, Flying Blue releases new Air France-KLM Flying Blue Promo Rewards that provide up to a 25% discount on different Flying Blue award tickets. These tickets can include economy, premium economy, and business class fares on Air France and KLM.

To put it into perspective, that means you could book a flight to Europe for as little as:

18,750 miles in economy

30,000 miles in premium economy

45,000 miles in business

You would have to add some taxes and fees onto these mileage prices, but you should still get excellent value from these promo redemptions.

To take it a step further, you could increase your redemption value even more if you were also able to take advantage of a transfer bonus on one of these fares.

For example, here’s how much you would need in Amex, Chase, Capital One, or Citi rewards for the same promo fares as above with a 20% transfer bonus (this is assuming you need to transfer in increments of 1,000 rewards each):

16,000 in transferred rewards = 19,200 miles

25,000 in transferred rewards = 30,000 miles

38,000 in transferred rewards = 45,600 miles

Stopovers

Flying Blue’s stopover program lets you add a complimentary stopover in Paris or Amsterdam on eligible award itineraries. Stopovers must be at least 24 hours but can last days or weeks. Meaning, you can be quite flexible with your travel arrangements without incurring additional costs for your flights.

Child discount

Flying Blue gives a 25% discount on award tickets booked for children aged 2 to 11. This should also work for children under the age of 2 who are in their own seat. Lap infants typically have their own discounts.

Calendar view

Flying Blue is one of the easiest programs to use when searching for award flights across a range of dates. If you open up the “Book with Miles” search tool on the KLM or Air France website, leave the “Departure date” field blank.

This will provide you with a calendar view that allows you to quickly see the lowest fares by month.

Note: We have seen issues occasionally with clicking through to a specific day, and it won’t show the same price as seen on the calendar — but these instances are relatively uncommon in our experience.

Elite status

Having elite status with Flying Blue or another SkyTeam Alliance airline, such as Delta, can get you certain benefits across the board. For Delta elite status holders, that could mean getting lounge access, extra baggage allowance, preferred seats, and priority boarding on Flying Blue flights.

Flight reservations

In our experience, it’s possible to call Flying Blue to hold an award ticket reservation. This is mainly useful in situations where you’re looking for award space, but haven’t actually transferred any points or miles into your Flying Blue account yet from another source.

In many cases, transfers are immediate. However, they can sometimes take longer, even up to a few days or more. In these cases, it’s helpful to have a customer service agent put the award fare on hold while you arrange the transfer. Otherwise, someone else could snap up that booking before you’re ready.

Note that there might be a small fee for putting an award ticket on hold over the phone or completing a held reservation over the phone, but an agent may waive the fee for you.

Miles expiration

Flying Blue Miles are valid for two years for Explorer Members aged 18 and older. You can extend the expiration date by two years with an Overall Extending Activity.

A qualifying activity typically includes earning Flying Blue Miles by completing an eligible flight with Air France, KLM, or a partner airline. You may also be able to extend the expiration date through other mileage-earning activities, such as transfers, although this isn’t explicitly stated in the Flying Blue terms.

What are Flying Blue Miles worth?

According to our valuations, Flying Blue Miles are typically worth about 1.2 cents per mile. That means:

10,000 Flying Blue Miles = $120

100,000 Flying Blue Miles = $1,200

1,000,000 Flying Blue Miles = $12,000

However, the value of your miles could be higher or lower depending on how you redeem them. Redeeming your miles toward flights will typically provide the best redemption value, but that value can vary.

For example, you can get much more value by redeeming your miles for a business class flight compared to one in economy class, simply because the cash prices for business class are much higher.

You can calculate the redemption value for any potential booking by dividing the cash price by the number of miles needed for the same fare. For instance, if a flight costs $240 or 20,000 miles, you would divide $240 by 20,000 and get 0.012, or a valuation of 1.2 cents per mile.

FAQs about Flying Blue

Is it free to join Flying Blue?

Yes, Flying Blue is free to join through the Air France and KLM websites.

How much is 100,000 Flying Blue Miles worth?

This is valued at approximately $1,200, according to our estimates. That’s a redemption value of 1.2 cents per mile.

Log in to your Flying Blue account through the KLM or Air France website, search for flights, and select a flight operated by Air France. Then pay for the booking with miles from your Flying Blue account.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.19%, within striking distance of its first record close since October. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also gained about 0.3%, eyeing its ninth positive close in 10 sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose around 0.2%, following a mixed Thursday session for the gauges.

Investors continue to bet heavily on a quarter-point interest rate cut from the central bank next Wednesday. Traders are pricing in 87% odds of a move lower, compared with 62% a month ago, according to CME FedWatch.

On Friday, a delayed reading of the PCE price index showed inflation rose about as expected in September. The ""core"" PCE index — the Fed's favored price gauge — cooled slightly, rising 2.8% on an annual basis. Meanwhile, US consumer confidence rose for the first time in five months as respondents' inflation expectations improved.

The jobs market, meanwhile, has presented more of a mixed bag of data this week. A Challenger report on Thursday showed US companies cut 71,000 jobs last month, the worst November print since 2022. Yet new weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest since September 2022, reinforcing the picture of a labor market cooling gradually rather than rapidly.

The overall preliminary sentiment reading compiled by the University of Michigan’s regular survey of consumers was 53.3, compared to last month’s level of 51. The median estimate from Bloomberg’s survey of economists projected December’s gauge hitting 52. The index hadn't increased on a monthly basis since July.

But consumer sentiment remains 28% lower than this time a year ago.

“Overall, while views of current conditions were little changed, expectations improved, led by a 13% rise in expected personal finances, with improvements visible across age, income, education, and political affiliation,” Joanne Hsu, the director of the survey of consumers, said in a statement Friday.

“Still, December’s reading on expected personal finances is nearly 12% below the beginning of the year,” Hsu continued. “Similarly, labor market expectations improved a touch but remained relatively dismal.”

Sentiment gains were driven by younger consumers, Hsu said, rising 4.5% from November.

Consumers expect prices to rise at a rate of 4.1% over the next year, the lowest reading since January and down from the expected 4.5% rate last month, the survey showed.

Hsu noted that consumers still don't necessarily feel positive, saying the ""overall tenor of views is broadly somber, as consumers continue to cite the burden of high prices.""

Data published this week has offered a mixed bag on the state of the economy.

How to earn World of Hyatt points

Hyatt hotel stays

World of Hyatt members earn up to 5 base points on eligible Hyatt stays and purchases. Hyatt members with elite status can earn up to a 30% bonus on eligible purchases, in addition to the base earning rate.

For example, an eligible $500 Hyatt stay would earn 2,500 points. With a 30% bonus, that’s an extra 750 points, for a total of 3,250 points. Considering Hyatt points are worth about 1.76 cents per point, that’s about $57 worth of points you could earn in this example.

Credit cards

You can earn Hyatt points directly with the World of Hyatt Credit Card and the World of Hyatt Business Credit Card. If you’re a World of Hyatt loyalist, these are excellent hotel credit cards to consider.

If you prefer more flexibility with your rewards points, consider cards that earn Chase Ultimate Rewards points. These points can be transferred to a travel partner, such as World of Hyatt, or redeemed through the Chase Travel℠ portal, giving you more opportunities to redeem your points however you want.

Check out these top Chase travel cards for earning Hyatt points:

Note that the Bilt Mastercard® also earns points that you can transfer to World of Hyatt.

Related: Best travel credit cards

Buying points

You can purchase up to 55,000 points per calendar year, starting at a minimum of 2,000 points and increasing in increments of 1,000. It’s typically not worth buying points unless there’s a good deal or you need to top off your points balance for a specific redemption, but it’s always an available option.

It typically costs $26 per 1,000 Hyatt points.

Sharing points

Unlike some travel loyalty programs, World of Hyatt has a generous stance when it comes to sharing points between accounts: it’s free to combine your points with any World of Hyatt member.

The only downside to combining points is that you must complete a point combining request form and email it to combinepoints@hyatt.com to initiate the process. You also have the option to mail your form to World of Hyatt Customer Service; however, emailing is likely a more convenient option.

Other ways to earn Hyatt points

Meetings and events: You can earn up to 50,000 Hyatt points for qualifying event spends at Hyatt Hotels. You can also earn 2 elite night credits toward tier status for every eligible $5,000 (up to $150,000) spent on meetings and events.

Experiences: World of Hyatt offers FIND Experiences, where you can book a variety of experiences, including tours, culinary outings, and spa treatments. You earn 10 base points for these bookings, plus 4x bonus points if using the World of Hyatt Credit Card, and up to 30% additional bonus points depending on your World of Hyatt status.

Peloton: You can earn bonus points on eligible Peloton purchases, as well as earn points for qualifying Peloton rides and rows taken at participating Hyatt locations.

Car rentals: World of Hyatt members can earn 500 Hyatt points and up to 25% off base rates for qualifying Avis rentals at participating Avis locations.

Airline partners: World of Hyatt partners with multiple airlines, including American Airlines, United, and Virgin Atlantic, to offer ways for you to earn airline miles on qualifying Hyatt stays.

How to book hotel stays with World of Hyatt

1. Sign up for a free World of Hyatt account on the Hyatt website or mobile app.

2. Log in to your account on the Hyatt website or app.

3. Enter your destination, number of guests, check-in date, and checkout date, and then select “Find Hotels.” Be sure to select the “Use Points” option if you want to search for award nights.

4. Select your hotel from the available options. You can typically browse a list of properties or use the map function.

5. Select “View Rates” on a hotel to see the rates for different room types. Then choose a room type based on your preferences and availability.

6. Once you’ve selected your room type, fill out any required information and book your stay. You typically have to attach a credit card to the reservation for incidental charges, even if booking an award night.

World of Hyatt sweet spots and booking examples

You’re almost guaranteed a good deal when award nights only cost 3,500 points at Category 1 Hyatt hotels on off-peak dates. Let’s check out the Hyatt Place Los Cabos to show what we mean.

In this example, you can pay $115.92 or 3,500 for a night. If you divide $115.92 by 3,500, you get a redemption value of approximately 3.3 cents per point, which is significantly higher than the average value of Hyatt points.

Properties with high cash prices

If you’re looking to maximize your Hyatt points with high redemption values, consider Hyatt properties that typically charge high cash prices. That means checking out luxury hotels, like thePark Hyatt Paris-Vendôme.

This one-night stay would cost $1,645.52 or 40,000 points. That gives you a redemption value of about 4.11 cents per point.

Who should care about the World of Hyatt program?

Families: We’ve had a lot of luck using the World of Hyatt program to travel the world as a family. Hyatt House and Hyatt Place are among the best Hyatt brands for families, especially in the U.S., as they offer spacious rooms for everyone and provide complimentary breakfast. Even better, you don’t need elite status for those two benefits.

Chase cardholders: Being able to earn Chase points and transfer those directly to your World of Hyatt account has been a game changer for us when searching for places to stay on trips. We use our Chase cards frequently, so it makes sense for us to redeem the points toward Hyatt stays.

Bilt cardholders: The Bilt Mastercard offers unique ways to earn valuable points on rent without incurring transaction fees. Similar to Chase, you can transfer your Bilt points to various travel partners, including World of Hyatt.

Flexible travelers: One of our favorite parts of the World of Hyatt program is that it’s not a purely dynamic pricing system. Hyatt has different award prices for off-peak, standard, and peak nights, which means you can pay fewer points if you book off-peak nights, which start at a mere 3,500 points per night. If you have the flexibility to choose when you want to travel, you can take advantage of off-peak pricing.

Business travelers: With its numerous locations worldwide, Hyatt offers business travelers a wide range of properties to choose from, along with high-quality benefits for loyal customers.

World of Hyatt tips and tricks

Points calendar

If you’re looking for award night availability at a specific Hyatt property, look for the “Points Calendar” option.

Selecting “Points Calendar” will provide a monthly view of award night prices at that property for the selected month, making it easier to plan your upcoming travel.

Worldwide Hyatt map

Based on our experience, World of Hyatt offers one of the easiest methods for browsing and exploring different hotel properties: the World of Hyatt map feature.

This map, available on the Hyatt website, displays every Hyatt property worldwide. So, you can quickly and easily browse properties by country, city, and region.

You can click on a specific property on the map or scroll in to see a list of properties in an area. You can also filter properties by brands, amenities, award categories, and more.

Filtering can be helpful for various reasons. For example, with this type of control, you can quickly see every Category 1 hotel in Asia, which could help you plan an upcoming trip to China or another country.

Transfers

While you can earn World of Hyatt points through various means, including using World of Hyatt Credit Cards and staying at Hyatt hotels, a more straightforward method for some will be to transfer points from a travel partner, such as Chase Ultimate Rewards or Bilt.

Milestone Rewards

The World of Hyatt program gifts its members with Milestone Rewards starting at 20 nights stayed in a calendar year. These are rewards you get to choose or automatically receive whenever you hit the required milestones each year. Here are some examples of valuable Milestone Rewards:

Free Night Award: Enjoy a free night at a participating Hyatt hotel. Note that Free Night Awards typically have Category stipulations. For example, a Category 1-4 Free Night Award only works at participating Category 1-4 Hyatt hotels.

Suite Upgrade Award: Treat yourself or someone else to a confirmed upgrade to a standard suite for stays of up to seven nights.

Guest of Honor: Gift yourself or someone else a Globalist experience for up to seven nights.

2K Next Stay Award: Earn 2,000 bonus points on your next stay at a Hyatt House, Hyatt Place, Me and All Hotels, Hyatt Studios, Hyatt Select, Unscripted by Hyatt, Caption by Hyatt, or UrCove hotel.

Club Access Award: Receive club lounge access at an eligible property with a club lounge.

Bonus Points: Receive bonus points to use toward a future free night, suite upgrade, or experience.

Keep in mind that many of these awards have expiration dates, so it’s worth checking that first before selecting an award. You also typically have a certain amount of time to choose your Milestone Rewards; otherwise, you may forfeit your reward.

Elite status shortcuts

Consider these options for earning World of Hyatt elite status quicker:

Credit cards: The World of Hyatt Credit Card automatically provides cardholders with 5 elite qualifying nights per year as a benefit. You can also earn 2 additional elite qualifying nights, with no limit, for every $5,000 you spend. The World of Hyatt Business Credit Card provides 5 elite qualifying nights for every $10,000 you spend.

Free Night Awards: You earn an elite qualifying night even when using Free Night Awards.

Guest of Honor: If you gift someone a Guest of Honor award and they use it, you’ll earn an elite qualifying night.

Meetings and events: You can earn 2 elite night credits per $5,000 (up to $150,000) spent on meetings and events at Hyatt properties.

Status challenge: Both Hyatt and American Airlines have offered fast-track promotions in the past, where you can earn World of Hyatt elite status by meeting less strict requirements than usual.

Semi-dynamic pricing

Hyatt uses semi-dynamic award pricing, which means the pricing for an award night can fluctuate depending on the property, dates, demand, and other factors. Hyatt doesn’t use true dynamic pricing, which means there are limits on how high or low the pricing will go.

For example, a night at a Category 1 Hyatt property typically costs 5,000 points. However, it can start at 3,500 points on off-peak nights and go up to 6,500 points on peak nights.

If you’re flexible, you can save a lot of points by booking Hyatt nights during off-peak periods.

Elite status benefits

In our opinion, some of the best World of Hyatt elite status benefits include:

Free parking: In general, if you’re a Globalist and book an award night, you get free parking for your stay. This has been huge for my family when we’ve stayed in the middle of big cities, where parking costs a premium.

Late checkout: In most cases, Globalist members receive a 4 p.m. checkout time. This has been amazing when we’ve wanted to spend a little more time at a destination or if we have a flight later and don’t need to be at the airport until the evening.

Room upgrades: Globalists often receive complimentary room upgrades, although this benefit can vary depending on the property, availability, and the staff member working at the front desk. Still, we’ve received free upgrades in the past, including in conjunction with using a Suite Upgrade Award, which has resulted in an even better suite upgrade overall.

Free breakfast: Globalist members receive complimentary breakfast at most Hyatt hotels. We love a free breakfast, so we love this benefit.

Offers

In your World of Hyatt account, you can check the “My Offers” tab for available offers to earn bonus points or something similar. Please note that you typically need to register for an offer to use it, so it’s advisable to check your account periodically. If you have a My Hyatt Concierge, they may automatically enroll you in every offer, so you don’t have to do it yourself.

Customer service

Based on our experience, the World of Hyatt customer service team has consistently provided above-average responses and service. Here are some of your options to reach the customer service team:

Online chat via the Hyatt website or mobile app

Sending a message on Twitter/X

Sending a message on Facebook

Sending an email directly to a Hyatt property

Calling the customer service team at 1-888-344-9288 (U.S. and Canada)

Calling the Hyatt Globalist line if you’re a Hyatt Globalist member

Calling the My Hyatt Concierge line if you have this elite status benefit

Brand Explorer

World of Hyatt provides its members with a benefit we haven’t seen elsewhere: earn a Free Night Award for every five unique Hyatt brands you experience.

Essentially, you get a Free Night Award for every fifth unique Hyatt brand you stay at. Previous brands you’ve stayed at don’t count.

It’s a fun and valuable perk that Hyatt doesn’t have to provide, but they do anyway.

Points expiration

World of Hyatt points expire after 24 consecutive months with no qualifying activity. Some qualifying activities include:

Earning points on eligible stays

Redeeming points

Gifting an eligible award to another member

Converting points into miles or credit with a travel partner

Purchasing points

Combining points with another World of Hyatt member’s account

Having an active Hyatt Credit Card associated with your World of Hyatt account

What are World of Hyatt points worth?

According to our valuations, World of Hyatt points are typically worth about 1.76 cents per mile. That means:

10,000 Hyatt points = $176

100,000 Hyatt points = $1,760

1,000,000 Hyatt points = $17,600

However, these valuations can vary depending on the redemption. Hyatt employs semi-dynamic pricing, which means that cash and award prices fluctuate somewhat according to dates, demand, and other factors. Because of this pricing model, you can see different redemption values depending on when you want to book and which property you’re looking at.

In some cases, you may get more value when booking award nights at higher category properties because they have higher cash prices, or if you book a stay at a particular property during a holiday, or if there’s a popular event happening.

To calculate the redemption value for any given Hyatt stay, divide the cash price by the number of points needed for the same stay. For example, if a hotel night costs $300 or 17,000 points, you divide $300 by 17,000 and get about 0.0176, or a valuation of 1.76 cents per point.

When checking cash and award night prices to find the redemption value, make sure the property, dates, and room type remain the same so you don’t throw off the calculation.

World of Hyatt FAQs

Is it free to be a World of Hyatt member?

Yes, it’s free to join the World of Hyatt loyalty program. As a member, you can earn 5x points at most Hyatt hotels and receive discounted member rates.

How many Hyatt points do I need for a free night?

Hyatt award nights start at 3,500 points per night at Category 1 properties on off-peak dates.

Is it cheaper to book directly through Hyatt?

It’s typically cheaper to book through Hyatt because of its Best Rate Guarantee, where Hyatt will match any eligible rate you find and give you an additional 20% off or 5,000 World of Hyatt points. World of Hyatt members can also get discounted rates on their stays.

What is the $50 charge at Hyatt Place?

Many hotels, including some Hyatt Place properties, charge a $50 daily incidental fee at check-in to cover potential incidental charges, such as in-room dining or on-property purchases. Unused portions of the fee are released upon checkout.

Which Hyatt status gets free breakfast?

Hyatt Globalists receive a complimentary full daily breakfast for up to two adults and two children at participating Hyatt hotels and resorts without a club lounge. If a property has a club lounge, Hyatt Globalists and applicable registered guests can enjoy complimentary breakfast daily in the lounge. At some locations, the lounge may also serve evening hors d’oeuvres.

The Q3 earnings season has largely brought solid results. As of Dec. 5, 99% of S&P 500 companies have reported, according to FactSet data, and analysts estimate a 13.4% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter. If it holds, that figure would mark the fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth and an acceleration from the 12% earnings growth rate reported in Q2 of this year.

Expectations were much lower coming into the quarter, as analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report a 7.9% jump in earnings per share in Q3, as of Sept. 30.

Source: FactSet

Following reports from retailers such as Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) this past week, investors will turn their attention toward earnings from specialty retailers GameStop (GME), AutoZone (AZO), and Chewy (CHWY). Another retail stalwart — Costco (COST) — is also scheduled to provide a quarterly update.

But the marquee report in the week ahead will likely come from Oracle (ORCL), which emerged as one of the AI leaders after a stunning second quarter report that highlighted the company's massive cloud backlog.

Earnings from Adobe (ADBE) and Broadcom (AVGO) will also feature next week to conclude the third quarter reporting season.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Netflix to acquire Warner Bros.' studios and HBO Max in landmark $72 billion deal,"Netflix (NFLX) is set to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) studio and streaming assets in a $72 billion deal, plus debt, bringing Hollywood’s most storied film and TV studio and the world’s largest streaming platform together in one of the biggest entertainment deals in history.

The companies announced Friday that they entered into a definitive agreement, subject to regulatory approval, that will give Netflix control of Warner Bros.’ film and TV studios, as well as HBO and HBO Max.

The deal is set to close after Warner Bros. Discovery completes its previously announced plan to separate its Global Networks division into a standalone publicly traded company.

Under that restructuring, expected in summer 2026, Netflix would take over the studios and streaming assets, while the newly created Discovery Global entity would house CNN and WBD’s portfolio of cable networks.

Netflix shares closed down nearly 3% following the news, while Warner Bros. Discovery shares gained 6%.

Read more about Netflix's and WBD's stock moves and today's market action.

Once completed, the acquisition would combine Warner Bros.’ century-long library and hit franchises — including “Harry Potter,” “DC,” “The Sopranos,” “Game of Thrones,” “Friends,” “The Big Bang Theory,” and “Casablanca” — with Netflix originals, including “Stranger Things,” “Wednesday,” “Bridgerton,” and “Squid Game.”

Netflix said it intends to maintain Warner Bros.’ current operations, including theatrical film releases.

The move is notable because Netflix has historically been a builder, not a buyer. The streamer has never executed a major acquisition and has leaned heavily into developing its own intellectual property.

The Netflix logo is shown in this photo from the company's website on Feb. 2, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) · ASSOCIATED PRESS

As of Q3, 63% of Netflix’s content assets were originals, and no single title represents more than 1% of total viewing, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth highlighted in a recent note. It's a level of diversification that cushions Netflix from consolidation elsewhere in the industry.

But the landscape is changing. With three subscale streamers — HBO Max, Paramount+, and Peacock — fighting for relevance, analysts say the only path to survival is scale, and Netflix may be seizing the chance to prevent a rival from gaining Warner Bros.’ intellectual property.

“Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a press release. “Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.""

Contentious battle for WBD

In the months leading up to Friday's announcement, Paramount (PSKY), Netflix, and Comcast (CMCSA) all submitted bids for WBD assets. Paramount even challenged the fairness of WBD’s process in a letter reviewed by CNBC earlier this week, an unusual public escalation that underscored how critical this deal was for the company’s future.","['Fri', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,5 easy banking and rewards hacks to maximize your holiday cash,"Holiday spending often winds up costing a lot more than people expect. Travel, gifts, food, and year-end commitments can add up fast.

The good news is you can tap into several banking and rewards strategies this month to boost your holiday funds without stressing your regular budget. With a few strategic steps, you can combine these tools and create a meaningful cushion to see yourself through the peak spending season.

1. Open a new bank account with a cash bonus

Banks often compete for new customers with bonus offers that reward you for opening a new account and completing a handful of requirements. You could earn a cash bonus of $100 to $400 — or even more in some cases. Usually, you’ll need to complete a minimum number of qualifying direct deposits and/or maintain a minimum average daily balance within a certain time frame to qualify.

To make this strategy work, compare bank bonus offers and review each requirement in detail. Once you meet the conditions, the bonus typically goes straight into your account. Keep in mind, however, that this process could take 45, 90, or even 120 days. So while a bonus might not hit in time for the holidays, it could be a great way to pay off credit card debt that might be lingering after the season ends.

2. Turn referral programs into extra cash

Another way to earn extra cash is by referring family members or friends to financial products you already use and trust. Numerous banks, credit card companies, and fintech apps reward customers with referral bonuses when they share the product with others.

Referral rewards often range from $10 to $100 or more (or the equivalent value in points). You can use these rewards to build up your holiday fund without a ton of extra effort.

Most referral programs are pretty straightforward, but it’s important to read the fine print to make sure you don’t miss out on potential rewards. Typically, you share a unique referral link with the person you’re referring, and they use that link to sign up. Once the person you refer satisfies the program requirements, the reward shows up in your account. Often, the person you refer receives a reward too.

A few examples of banks and apps that offer referral programs include American Express, Chase, SoFi, Ally, Cash App, and others. Programs change often. So check the referral page on each bank or app’s website for rules and reward details.

3. Use credit card welcome offers wisely

Credit card welcome bonuses can create a major holiday surplus when you use them responsibly. Many issuers offer sign-up offers worth hundreds of dollars in value to new cardholders who meet a minimum spending requirement during their first few months from account opening.

The smartest approach here matches up the bonus requirement with the spending you already plan to do. And if your budget is higher for the holiday season, that number might look a bit higher than your average monthly budget.

Remember, it’s important to review the details of each credit card sign-up bonus and compare card features such as annual fees, interest rates, and ongoing rewards. Once you earn the bonus, you can redeem the rewards to fund travel, pay down your card balance (with cash-back credit cards), and more.

4. Redeem existing rewards strategically

Many people overlook rewards they have already earned during the holiday season. However, your loyalty program rewards, credit card points, and cash back could boost your holiday budget right away. Even so, the value you receive for your rewards redemptions depends on the choices you make.

You can maximize the value of credit card rewards and stretch them further. Gift cards and “pay with points” tools, for example, are often a poor way to redeem your credit card points. These tools feel convenient, but they often reduce the value of your rewards. If you plan to travel during the holidays, you’ll likely get more value from your points by redeeming them for flights or hotels and saving your cash for holiday shopping.

Cash back can also offer a quick way to add money to your holiday fund. You can redeem it as a statement credit or move the cash into a separate savings account (preferably a high-yield savings account to help your money grow faster).

Before you redeem rewards, keep the following tips in mind.

Compare the value of each redemption option, including transfer partners and credit card rewards portal choices. Choose travel redemptions when you want the highest value, and remember to consider credit card transfer partners to unlock potential added value. Consider cash back redemptions when you want immediate holiday budget support.

5. Stack online shopping rewards before checkout

Shopping portals and cash-back browser extensions can help you save money or earn more rewards when shopping online. These tools allow you to stack rewards on holiday purchases you already planned to make.

Many shoppers use a cash-back or rewards browser extension, such as Rakuten or Kudos. And some credit card issuers also offer online shopping portals. These tools enable cardholders to earn extra points or cash back on top of their normal card earnings by starting their shopping trip through the portal and clicking through to online retailers. You can also combine the tools and multiply your rewards-earning potential.

When you combine a shopping portal, a browser extension, and a rewards credit card, that’s where the magic really happens. With this strategy, you create three layers of value on the same purchase. It does take a little extra effort to keep up with multiple rewards programs, but the added value is worthwhile.

Combine multiple hacks for a bigger boost

When it comes to boosting holiday cash flow, many people combine several methods together to maximize benefits. If you can manage this approach responsibly, it could be a valuable strategy.

A credit card welcome offer could offer hundreds of dollars worth of rewards for purchases you already plan to make. Shopping portals help you earn more cash back or points from those purchases. Meanwhile, researching the best ways to redeem the rewards you earn (and already have banked) ensures you get the most value possible for your redemptions.

The combination can create a flexible, low-stress way to cut holiday spending without credit card debt.

Bottom line

Holiday budgets work best when you plan ahead and use the financial tools that already exist in your everyday life. Banks and card issuers offer bonuses and rewards that can grow a holiday fund faster than many people expect. Shopping portals and cash-back tools can stretch your spending even further.

You don’t need a complicated plan to boost your holiday cash. A few intentional moves often create enough breathing room to enjoy the season without stress and debt.","['Michelle Lambright Black', 'Fri', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA: How to pick the right one,"You have two options for individual retirement accounts (IRAs): traditional or Roth. Which one can help you secure the retirement you want? Find out now with this breakdown of how traditional and Roth IRAs differ. We'll also cover the factors to consider when choosing between these retirement account types.

This embedded content is not available in your region.

Learn more: What is an IRA and how does it work?

Understanding IRAs

Traditional and Roth IRAs have powerful tax advantages that help you save more for retirement. Both offer tax-deferred earnings. This means you do not pay taxes annually on capital gains, dividends, and interest earned within the account.

Tax-deferred growth speeds up wealth production by sparing you an annual tax expense on the money earned. You can leave your funds invested and growing rather than taking withdrawals to pay Uncle Sam.

Traditional and Roth accounts also have other tax benefits:

Traditional IRAs offer tax-free contributions under certain conditions. Tax-free contributions reduce your taxable income and, in turn, your taxes. Saving is cheaper because lower taxes offset a portion of your contribution. You will pay taxes later when you withdraw funds from your account in retirement. Roth IRA contributions are after-tax, meaning they are not deductible. They do not affect your current income or taxes in the current year. Qualified Roth withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

Factors to consider

The relevant differences between traditional and Roth IRAs go beyond the timing of certain tax benefits. They also have different restrictions on contributions and withdrawals. To evaluate which account type suits your situation better, consider your tax outlook, current income, 401(k) access, and liquidity needs.

Tax outlook

The traditional IRA provides up-front tax benefits in the form of tax-free contributions. This is an advantage when you are in a higher tax bracket today versus your expected tax bracket in retirement. You can use a traditional IRA to forgo higher taxes today and pay lower taxes later.

With a Roth IRA, you pay taxes now on your contributions and enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Mathematically, this saves you money if you are in a higher tax bracket in your senior years. Tax-free income in retirement is also easier to budget and may contribute to lower Medicare premiums.

Current income

The IRS has eligibility requirements for Roth IRA contributions. The 2025 annual contribution limit is $7,000, or $8,000 if you are over 50. In 2026, you can contribute up to $7,500, or $8,600 after your 50th birthday.

These are not per-account limits. They apply to all IRAs in your name. You can split your contributions between a traditional and Roth account — but only to the extent you are eligible for Roth contributions.

Annual income limits govern eligibility for Roth IRA contributions. The IRS defines income here as modified adjusted gross income.

Rules for single taxpayers include:

Single taxpayers earning less than $153,000 annually can make a full Roth IRA contribution. Single taxpayers earning $153,000 to $168,000 can make a partial Roth IRA contribution. Allowed amounts are calculated based on income and are less than the $7,500 limit or $8,600 for those over 50. Single taxpayers earning $168,000 or more are not eligible to make Roth IRA contributions.

Roth IRA contribution rules for married taxpayers filing jointly include:

Couples earning less than $153,000 can make a full Roth IRA contribution for the year. Couples earning $242,000 to $252,000 can make a partial Roth IRA contribution. Couples earning more than $252,000 cannot make Roth IRA contributions.

Learn more: These are the traditional IRA and Roth IRA limits in 2026

Access to a 401(k)

Your income does not limit how much you can contribute to a traditional IRA. However, it may affect the deductibility of your IRA contributions if you also have access to a workplace 401(k). The IRS sets separate income limits for single taxpayers and those who are married and filing jointly. The rules for couples vary depending on whether the spouse making the contribution has a 401(k).

Singles earning $81,000 or less annually can fully deduct their traditional IRA contributions. Singles earning $81,000 to $91,000 annually can partially deduct traditional IRA contributions. Singles earning $91,000 or more annually cannot deduct traditional IRA contributions.

Learn more: What is a 401(k)? A guide to the rules and how it works.

The limits for married taxpayers filing jointly who also have a 401(k) are:

Couples earning $129,000 or less annually can fully deduct traditional IRA contributions. Couples earning $129,000 to $149,000 annually can partially deduct traditional IRA contributions. Couples earning $149,000 or more annually cannot deduct traditional IRA contributions.

Non-deductible traditional IRA contributions are less appealing than non-deductible Roth IRA contributions because traditional IRA withdrawals in retirement are taxable, while qualified Roth withdrawals are tax-free. But, if your income prohibits you from Roth contributions, non-deductible traditional contributions may still be worthwhile because of the tax-deferred growth.

Learn more: 401(k) vs. IRA: The differences and how to choose which is right for you

Liquidity needs

Generally, you should not withdraw funds from any IRA before age 59 ½. Doing so can prompt penalties and fees from the IRS. However, Roth IRAs have more relaxed withdrawal rules than traditional IRAs. For this reason, Roth IRAs are a better source of emergency liquidity than traditional IRAs.

What's different about Roth accounts is that you can withdraw your contributions at any time without restriction or penalty. The IRS only restricts the withdrawal of earnings from the account. The distinction between the contributions and the earnings exists because their tax statuses differ. As noted, you make Roth contributions with after-tax funds, but the earnings are tax-deferred.

Traditional IRAs don't have that distinction. Early withdrawal of contributions or earnings in a traditional account triggers taxes and penalties.

The right retirement account

Some savers rely on their tax outlook to choose between traditional and Roth IRA contributions. If they expect a lower tax bracket in retirement, they'll put more funds in a traditional IRA and vice versa. Those with an uncertain tax outlook may opt to diversify and contribute to both account types, assuming they are eligible. Still, others may prefer the convenience of tax-free retirement income from a Roth IRA — even if it means paying more taxes now.

How you choose to tackle this decision is up to you. More important is your commitment to regular, ongoing retirement contributions. Focus on establishing a sizable nest egg in whatever account makes sense now. Managing some tax consequences later is a good problem to have if it confirms you've saved enough for a comfortable retirement.

Gold futures hovered around $4,240, on track for a less than 1% increase this week and more than $100 off its October record high.

Investors overwhelmingly expect the Federal Reserve to cut the fed funds rate by 25 basis points next week. The expectation has put pressure on the US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB), lifting commodity prices invoiced in greenback currency.

Gold also tends to rise as interest rates fall and investors move away from interest-yielding assets like bonds.

The precious metal has surpassed more than 50 all-time highs this year, surging more than 60% year to date, making it a top asset for 2025, behind silver (SI=F), which is up roughly 100% year to date.

By comparison, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has gained about 17% during the same period, while bitcoin (BTC-USD) is down roughly 2%.

According to a World Gold Council report, ""momentum has played a larger role than in previous years, which is not surprising considering how gold's strong rally has prompted widespread investor interest.""

""At the same time, central banks continued their buying spree — with demand well above average, even if below the records seen in the previous three years,"" according to the study released on Thursday.

As gold heads toward its best annual return since 1979, continued fiscal spending and lower interest rates, along with a weaker dollar, should support higher prices in 2026.

""Our analysis shows that, in this environment, gold could rise 5%–15% in 2026 from current levels,"" the World Gold Council said. Given today's prices, that would amount to as much as $4,900 per troy ounce.

""In addition, continued strategic central bank buying and potential new investment entrants, such as insurance companies in China or pension funds in India, could further support gold's positive trend,"" the report said.

On Thursday, Goldman Sachs analysts reiterated a ""structurally bullish outlook for gold,"" with a price target of $4,900 by the end of next year.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,How to make your first student loan payment,"Grace periods for many spring graduates are coming to an end, which means that first student loan payments are due soon. A grace period is the window of time — typically six months — between graduation and when loan repayment begins.

However, timelines vary depending on loan type. Federal loans generally offer a standard six-month grace period, while private lenders set their own terms, which can range from immediate repayment to longer grace periods.

Understanding these differences and preparing early can help you avoid late fees, credit damage, and unnecessary stress as you transition into repayment.

1. Confirm your loan servicer and create an online account

Your loan servicer handles billing and repayment, but it may not be the same entity listed on your original FAFSA or school paperwork. For federal student loans, verify your servicer by logging into StudentAid.gov and checking your loan details. The site lists all your federal loans and shows which company services each one.

For private student loans, review any notifications you've received by email or check your original loan documents for servicer contact information. Some lenders service their own loans, while others transfer servicing to third-party companies.

Once you've identified your servicer, create an online account immediately. This gives you access to critical information, including your exact balance, interest rate, payment due dates, and repayment plan options. Setting up online access early also makes it easier to enroll in autopay and monitor your account going forward.

Related: Federal vs. private student loans

The simplest way to confirm your first payment amount and due date is by checking your loan servicer’s online account dashboard. This is where servicers post your official repayment schedule, including:

Your payment due date

The minimum amount due

Ongoing repayment plan details

Relying solely on paper statements can be risky, since mail can be delayed or sent to an old address. Logging in directly ensures you see the most accurate, up-to-date information for all your loans in one place.

Federal borrowers are automatically enrolled in the standard 10-year repayment plan, but this isn't your only option. Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans calculate payments based on your income, which can significantly reduce what you owe each month — especially if you have a low starting salary or inconsistent hours.

To switch plans, apply through StudentAid.gov before your first payment is due. Updating your income information early prevents you from being locked into an unaffordable payment amount.

Related: Can you change your student loan repayment plan?

4. Add your banking information and set up autopay

Enrolling in autopay reduces the risk of late payments and typically earns you a 0.25% interest rate discount — a benefit offered by all federal servicers and many private lenders. While 0.25% may seem small, it can save you hundreds of dollars over the life of your loan.

Before autopay kicks in, double-check your routing and account numbers in your servicer's system. An incorrect digit can cause failed payments, triggering late fees and potentially damaging your credit. Consider scheduling your payment to withdraw a few days after your regular payday to ensure sufficient funds are available and prevent overdrafts.

5. Make your first payment manually if needed

Sometimes autopay doesn't activate until the second billing cycle, meaning you'll need to make your first payment manually. Log in to your servicer's dashboard, navigate to the payment section, and follow the prompts to submit a one-time payment from your bank account.

After submitting, save your confirmation number, and then check your account a few days later to confirm the payment was applied correctly.

Best practices for new borrowers

Making your first payment is just the beginning. These strategies will help you manage your loans effectively and minimize long-term costs:

Track your interest and principal breakdown: Each payment you make is split between interest and principal. Early in the repayment process, most of your payment goes toward interest, with only a small portion reducing your actual loan balance. Understanding this breakdown helps you see how extra payments can accelerate payoff and reduce total interest costs.

Pay a little extra toward principal if you can: Even small additional payments make a difference. For example, adding just $25 per month to a $30,000 loan at 6% can save nearly $1,000 in interest and shorten your repayment timeline by roughly a year. When making extra payments, specify that the additional amount should apply to the loan’s principal balance — not be held as a prepayment for future months.

Update your contact information everywhere: Missed emails and letters can translate to missed bills, which can lead to late fees and credit damage. Update your address, phone number, and email with your loan servicer, especially if you've moved since graduation or are transitioning away from your student email address.

Understand how missed payments affect your credit: Payments that are 30 or more days late — or 90 days for federal student loans — can be reported to credit bureaus, damaging your credit score for up to seven years. Making on-time payments from day one builds a strong foundation for future financial goals like buying a car or home.

What to do if your first payment feels unaffordable

If your first payment feels out of reach, don't panic — and don't ignore it. There are several ways you can reduce your monthly obligation before you fall behind:

Switch to an income-driven repayment plan: You don't need to wait until after your first payment to apply for an IDR plan. If the standard payment feels unmanageable, apply immediately at StudentAid.gov/IDR. Processing can take roughly a month, so acting early ensures your lower payment is in place before you risk missing a deadline.

Ask your servicer about temporary relief: Short-term deferment or forbearance options can pause payments for a few months while you stabilize your finances. However, interest may continue to accrue during these periods, increasing your total loan cost. Use these options sparingly and only when truly necessary.

Revisit your monthly budget: Before missing a payment, examine where your money is going. Are you overspending on rent, dining out, or subscription services? Adjustments such as finding a roommate, cooking at home more often, or canceling unused subscriptions can free up cash for loan payments without drastically impacting your lifestyle.

Making your first student loan payment is a significant milestone, but it's entirely manageable with preparation. Confirm your servicer, set up your online account, enroll in autopay, and choose the right repayment plan before your due date arrives.

Establishing good habits early, including paying on time, tracking your balance, and communicating with your servicer, can set you up for long-term financial stability.

Want a lower interest rate? Student loan refinancing could help you better manage your debt.

According to Tesla's website in the Netherlands, the Model 3 Standard is on sale for 36,990 euros ($43,130), compared to 45,990 euros ($53,620) for the Premium Long Range. As in the US, the Standard models are ""de-contented,"" meaning they lack features such as premium materials (like cloth seats), a rear passenger infotainment screen, a glass roof, and enhanced lighting, among other things. The Standard models also have less powerful motors and decreased range.

In the US, the Model 3 Standard costs $36,990, compared to $42,490 for the Premium rear-wheel drive.

As for the Model Y, the Dutch website lists the Standard edition for 39,990 euros ($46,630) versus 50,990 euros ($59,450) for the Premium Long Range. Compared to the US, the Standard Model Y is priced at $39,990 and $44,990 for the Premium.

Both models are available for delivery in December. Tesla stock was little changed on the news, but shares are up 6% for the week as the broader tech sector recovers.

Introduction of the Standard versions of Tesla's most popular EVs comes as the company's sales tumble in the region.

According to its most recent report, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) said Tesla electric vehicle registrations (a proxy for sales) in Europe fell to just 6,964 units in October, a 48.5% drop compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, total EV registrations in the region, which includes the UK and the European Free Trade Association, rose 32.9% in October, with overall registrations regardless of powertrain up 4.9%.

Tesla cars are parked at the car manufacturer in Parsdorf near Munich (Bavaria, Germany) on Oct. 28, 2025. While the market share of e-cars in Europe is recovering, sales of vehicles from co-founder and CEO Musk's company have plummeted. (Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) · picture alliance via Getty Images

In the first 10 months of the year, Tesla sales dropped 29.6% to 180,688 units, per the ACEA. Conversely, Tesla's overall market share in Europe dropped to 1.6% from 2.4% a year ago.

Meanwhile, Tesla's Chinese competitor BYD (BYDDY), which sells a mix of pure EVs and hybrids, reported sales jumping 207% to 17,470 units sold in Europe. Another major China rival, SAIC, saw sales climb 46% to just under 24,000 vehicles sold.

Competition isn't the only reason Tesla is suffering in the region. Musk blames higher interest rates and an uneven economic outlook, but many buyers in the region are put off by Musk's embrace of far-right politicians in the bloc and his on-again, off-again relationship with President Trump.

It remains to be seen whether the Standard Model 3 and Model Y can blunt the negative tide Tesla faces in Europe.","['Fri', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"

Discover’s cash-back calendar is centered around everyday expenses — often including restaurants, grocery stores, and more.

And the categories for the first quarter of 2026 are no exception. Between Jan. 1 and March 31, cardholders can earn 5% cash back at grocery stores, at wholesale clubs, and on select streaming services.

Here’s a closer look at what you can get with these categories and how to decide if a Discover cash-back card is right for you.

Discover Q1 cash-back categories

Through the first quarter of 2026, you can earn 5% cash back with your eligible Discover card on groceries at grocery stores and wholesale clubs, as well as on select streaming services. The 5% rewards apply to the first $1,500 in combined purchases when you activate.

Grocery stores

Whether you're starting on a New Year's resolution or trying to cook more at home to save money after the holidays, this category can help you get a jumpstart on your goals this quarter.

Eligible retailers include supermarkets, smaller grocery stores, and even grocery delivery services. However, grocery spending at Walmart and Target is not eligible.

Wholesale clubs

Alongside regular grocery stores, you can also earn bonus rewards when you shop at wholesale clubs this quarter. But keep in mind: wholesale clubs don't always accept Discover credit cards. For example, you'll need to use a Visa credit card if you're shopping at Costco. To earn 5% rewards on eligible purchases at wholesale clubs, make sure you can use your Discover card to pay.

Discover also specifies that certain services provided by some wholesale clubs, like travel, delivery services, or cell phone purchases, may not earn 5% rewards.

Select streaming services

You'll save on your streaming subscriptions this quarter when you pay with your Discover card, too. Some eligible streaming services include Apple TV, Audible, DirecTV Stream, Netflix, Peacock, SiriusXM, Spotify, YouTube Premium, and more.

One exception to note is a subscription bundled with or billed through a third party. For example, if you get your HBO Max subscription through your cable provider or your SiriusXM subscription through your car manufacturer, you may not be able to earn 5% back with your card.

Discover rotating cash-back calendar for 2026

These are the Discover rotating cash-back categories from 2024 to Q1 2026:

The 2026 Q1 categories provide excellent opportunities to earn 5% back on everyday expenses at grocery stores and on streaming. To earn 5% back, you must activate the offer and then make purchases in the applicable categories.

Previous Discover cash-back categories have included:

PayPal (Q3 2022)

Fitness clubs (Q1 2022)

Gym memberships (Q1 2022)

Walgreens and CVS (Q1 2021)

Uber and Lyft (Q2 2020)

How Discover rotating cash-back categories work

Discover rotating categories are cash-back bonus categories available on certain Discover cash-back credit cards. These categories offer 5% cash back (on $1,500 in purchases per quarter after activation) and rotate quarterly. Few other cash-back credit cards offer 5% back on purchases, making the Discover rotating categories especially valuable.

Maximizing your earnings with the Discover rotating categories (spending $1,500 per quarter) could earn you $75 in cash back quarterly or $300 annually. That’s not bad for purchases you might already be making anyway.

How to activate Discover rotating categories

You can activate your 5% rotating categories for the quarter through the Discover mobile app, your online account, or by calling the Discover customer service number on the back of your credit card. You can also activate through a Discover email if you’ve received one.

You won’t earn 5% on applicable purchases unless you activate each quarter. You can typically activate after the quarter has already started, but you won’t earn 5% retroactively on any purchases you’ve already made.

How to make the most of Discover rotating categories

I've had a Discover credit card for many years and noticed that the quarterly bonus categories tend to follow similar patterns yearly.

For example, you might see grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations announced in any of the first three quarters of the year. However, Q4 is often reserved for categories related to holiday shopping, which could include Amazon.com.

Knowing this, you could better align your spending with the 5% rotating categories and pad your cash-back rewards. Of course, you can’t know for sure which categories will be announced ahead of time.

Fortunately, Discover typically announces rotating categories a month before they go live. That gives you a buffer to make some adjustments to upcoming spending. For example, if gas stations were just announced for the next quarter, maybe that’s an opportunity to take that road trip you’ve been planning.

Tip: Purchasing gift cards can be an easy way to maximize hitting the $1,500 spending limit each quarter. Many grocery stores, gas stations, drug stores, and other locations sell gift cards you can use later for other expenses. That could include buying Amazon, Home Depot, or other types of gift cards, depending on your upcoming purchases.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,How are stocks impacted when the Fed doesn’t change interest rates?,"Interest rates have been making headlines since the pandemic. Ultra-low inflation, followed by historically high price increases between 2020 and early 2023, prompted many consumers and investors to pay attention to interest rates and how the Fed manages them.

The Fed adjusts interest rates — specifically, the federal funds rate — to address inflation and unemployment trends. The federal funds rate is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. This rate influences banks’ cost of capital, so they use it to set pricing on loans made to consumers and businesses. Said another way, the rates you pay on credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans generally rise and fall with the federal funds rate.

Stock prices often react to the Fed’s rate actions too. Lower rates can prompt a rise in stock prices, while higher rates can push stock prices lower. But what happens when the Fed leaves rates the same? Let’s answer that question now, and share some tips on adjusting your portfolio to the current rate environment.

Economic significance of no rate change

The Fed’s management of interest rates requires a delicate balance between stimulating the economy and controlling inflation. Lower interest rates boost consumer and business spending, which is good for stock prices. However, if rates fall too quickly, inflation may increase — and that's bad for stock prices.

The Fed’s decision to leave rates unchanged signals that the economy is strong, but inflation could easily return.

Learn more: Jobs, inflation, and the Fed: How they're all related

Investor expectations

In theory, stable interest rates should not prompt big changes in stock prices. But there is another factor to watch: the expectations of the investment community.

Investor expectations can trigger stock price swings when those expectations diverge from the Fed’s decision. For example, if investors believe the Fed should have cut rates, stock prices can drop. If investors believe the Fed should have raised rates, stock prices can rise. As David Russell, global head of marketing strategy at trading platform TradeStation, explained, “The Fed’s main impact on the stock market is to confirm or reject expectations about rates and the economy.”

You can get a sense of current investor expectations by checking CME FedWatch. This resource uses 30-day federal funds rate futures prices to predict the Fed’s rate actions.

Adjusting your portfolio

With interest rates unchanged and investors in agreement with the Fed’s strategy, are portfolio adjustments necessary? The answer depends on the current positioning of your investments.

Consider three questions:

Have you updated your holdings recently on the assumption that rates would change? If so, reevaluate your portfolio now. Confirm you are comfortable with your allocations given a more modest outlook for rate declines. If you have made changes, are you still comfortable predicting interest rates and economic trends? Molding your investments to fit current and future circumstances can create higher returns — only if most of your predictions are accurate. However, betting wrong once or twice can undermine returns. The good news is you can get off the prediction roller coaster by adopting a long-term strategy instead. That involves setting up an allocation to rely on continuously rather than adjusting for short-term circumstances. Is your strategy largely unchanged from last year or the year before? The advantage of a long-term approach is feeling comfortable holding your portfolio steady through rate changes and economic cycles. If your current strategy is working for you, there probably isn’t a reason to change.

Learn more: Create a stock investing strategy in 3 steps

Keep the perspective broad in 2026

The federal funds rate is one factor among many that affects the investment climate and stock prices. If you intend to manage your investments to suit the current environment, keep a close watch on broader economic and corporate profit trends, as well as interest rates.

Ultimately, corporate profits are the main factor driving stock prices. Profits are affected by interest rates, consumer and business spending, inflation, and more. Many investors respond to these factors as predictors of profit trends. As noted, the predictive approach comes with the risk of being wrong.

If you prefer to stay conservative, fill your portfolio with high-quality stocks that have proven themselves in all economic cycles. Then, wait patiently for long-term growth.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,What are the mortgage rate predictions for the next 5 years?,"Mortgage rates have dropped by a half-point over the last year, according to Freddie Mac. However, those looking to buy a house or refinance in the next few years may wonder where rates are headed in the long term. Mortgage interest rates are determined by several factors, with the 10-year Treasury yield being a primary one. At Yahoo Finance, we’ve designed a five-year mortgage rate forecast, built on a 10-year yield correlation, that provides some insight.

Mortgage rates are tuned to the government bond market

Mortgage rate forecasts might best be derived from 10-year Treasury note trends. While the two rates often track in the same direction, there is a spread between them that we will account for below.

First, let's understand where Treasury yields are headed in the next five years. We'll combine human analysis with data pulled from artificial intelligence to put together a prediction.

Economists' 5-year forecast for Treasury rates

Michael Wolf is a global economist at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd. In June, the Deloitte Global Economics Research Center issued an updated U.S. economic forecast in which Wolf laid out the firm's Treasury yield expectations over the next five years.

""We expect the 10-year Treasury yield to hover near 4.5% for the remainder of this year, despite a softening in economic data and a 50-basis-point cut from the Fed in the fourth quarter of 2025,"" he wrote. ""The 10-year Treasury yield begins to decline slowly in 2026, falling to 4.1% by 2027 and remaining there through the end of 2029.""

Let's chart that forecast.

That's not much movement. Goldman Sachs analysts agree, saying the 10-year Treasury will remain near 4.1% through 2027.

Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts the Treasury yield to be 4.1% by the end of 2025, down to 4% in 2026 and remaining near 3.9% through 2029.

Estimating a 5-year spread

As we mentioned up top, the 10-year Treasury and 30-year fixed mortgage rates are separated by a spread. That difference between the two has been on either side of 2.5 percentage points in recent years. That's a significant change when compared to the spread from 2010 to 2020 when it was under two percentage points — and often near 1.5.

Using a 2.5 percentage point spread, here's an example of how Treasurys and mortgage rates compare:

10-year Treasury rate = 4%

Spread = 2.5 percentage points

Mortgage rates = 6.5%

Here's a recent example: On Dec. 4, 2025, the 10-year Treasury yield opened at 4.09%, and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.19%. The spread was 6.19 - 4.09 = 2.10 percentage points.

The latest version of artificial intelligence, GPT-5, suggested using a spread of 2.1 to 2.3 percentage points. Here is its rationale:

Historical standard (2010s) : ~1.7 pp

Recent years (2022 to 2025) : ~2.6 pp

Estimated 5-year average spread: ~2.1 to 2.3 percentage points

Using these spread estimates, we can now complete our five-year mortgage rate forecast.

The 5-year mortgage rate forecast

Using the Treasury forecast from above, we add the spread between the bond market and 30-year fixed mortgage rates to compile a five-year forecast:

The margin of error

Of course, these are long-range estimates based on historical norms and broad expectations. All of these numbers could be thrown out the window if any of the following happens:

10-year Treasurys outperform or underperform the forecast. For example, yields could crash in a severe economic setback, such as a recession. The spread between Treasurys and mortgage rates narrows — or dramatically expands. Monetary policy, as driven by the Federal Reserve, substantially changes.

Mortgage rate predictions for the next 5 years FAQs

Will mortgage interest rates ever be 3% again?

There is no forecast that predicts a 3% mortgage rate in the next five years. However, who saw such low home loan rates on the horizon in 2007 when rates were about where they are now? Things like the Great Recession and a global pandemic are rarely on the radar, and such drastic events are what it takes to move mortgage rates into the cellar.

What will mortgage rates be in 2027?

The analysis above predicts 2027 mortgage rates to be around 6.2% to 6.4%.

Will mortgage rates drop in the next 5 years?

Based on the estimates above, mortgage rates are not expected to drop significantly in the next five years. However, a recession or other unknown disruption to the economy (such as a financial collapse or pandemic) could change the outlook.

Is it better to fix a rate for 2 or 5 years?

If you are considering an adjustable-rate mortgage with an initial fixed-rate period, you'll first want to consider how long you'll actually remain in the house you are financing. Then the long-term mortgage rate forecasting begins. The best approach is probably to select the initial term that best suits your current budget.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,"What is an IRA, and how does it work?","An individual retirement account (IRA) is a type of investment account that allows you to save for retirement independently of your employer. Because IRAs aren’t tied to your job (with a few exceptions that we’ll discuss shortly), they’re a good option for self-employed people. However, you can also open an IRA to supplement your savings in a workplace account, like a 401(k) or 403(b).

If you want to invest in an IRA but aren’t sure where to start, keep reading. We’ll explain all things IRAs, including the major types of IRAs, the basic rules, and how you can open one. We’ll also cover how IRAs stack up against 401(k)s and other retirement accounts.

Types of IRAs

An IRA is a tax-advantaged account that you open through a brokerage to save for retirement. Usually, you open an IRA on your own, but there are a few types of IRAs, like SEP IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs, that an employer can open on your behalf.

We’ll focus on the two main types of IRAs that individuals can open: traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.

Traditional IRAs

Traditional IRAs are funded with pre-tax money. You may be able to deduct contributions for tax purposes, depending on your income and whether you or your spouse participates in a workplace retirement plan.

Your money then grows on a tax-deferred basis. The tax bill comes due when you withdraw your money, as distributions are taxable as ordinary income. If you take distributions before age 59 ½, you’ll typically face a 10% early withdrawal penalty as well.

Learn more: Traditional vs Roth IRAs

Roth IRAs

Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, which means you don’t get a tax break in the year you contribute. As with a traditional IRA, your money grows on a tax-deferred basis. But if you wait until you’re 59 ½ and you’ve held the account for at least five years, distributions will be tax-free. You can also access your contributions (but not the earnings) without owing taxes or a penalty at any time.

There are a few other types of IRAs you may hear about, but they’ll all have either a traditional (pre-tax) structure or a Roth (post-tax) structure:

Rollover IRA: A rollover IRA is an account that’s set up so you can transfer money from a past employer’s retirement plan without incurring taxes or a penalty.

SEP IRA: SEP IRAs are designed for small business owners, the self-employed, or freelancers.

SIMPLE IRA: Though most IRAs are opened independently of employers, SIMPLE IRAs are an exception. A SIMPLE IRA is a retirement account that businesses with 100 or fewer employees can set up to help workers save. Compared to other workplace plans, they’re usually easier and less costly to administer.

Custodial IRA: A custodial IRA is an account that an adult (usually a parent or guardian) can set up and manage on behalf of a child who earns income. Once the child reaches the age of majority, which is 18 in most states, they’ll have full control of the funds.

Spousal IRA: A spousal IRA is a traditional or Roth IRA that a working spouse can fund on behalf of a spouse with little or no annual income. The couple must be legally married and file a joint tax return to qualify.

Inherited IRA: If you inherit an IRA or another retirement plan from a loved one, you can set up an inherited IRA to hold the funds. You won’t be allowed to make additional contributions, though, and you’ll need to deplete the account within 10 years of the original owner’s death.

IRA rules

IRAs have generous tax advantages, but you’ll need to follow several rules to reap the full benefits. Here are the basic requirements you should know about before you start investing.

IRA eligibility

You can contribute to both types of IRAs regardless of age, but you’ll need to have taxable compensation, also known as earned income, for the year in which you contribute. The IRS defines earned income as basically any income you earn from working, such as a salary, hourly wages, tips, commission, or self-employment income.

Anyone with taxable compensation can contribute to a traditional IRA regardless of income. However, you may not be able to deduct your contribution if you or your spouse has access to a workplace retirement plan and your income exceeds certain thresholds.

Roth IRA income limits

Roth IRAs have income limits. In 2025, you can make the full contribution if you’re single with a modified gross adjusted income (MAGI) of less than $150,000, or married filing jointly with a combined income of less than $236,000. Those with higher incomes may be able to contribute a reduced amount. However, single filers with incomes above $165,000 and joint filers earning more than $246,000 aren’t eligible to directly fund a Roth IRA in 2025.

In 2026, you can make a full IRA contribution if you’re single with a MAGI of less than $153,000, or married filing jointly with a combined MAGI of less than $242,000. You can make partial Roth contributions if you’re single and earn between $153,000 and $168,000, or married and earn a combined income between $242,000 and $252,000. No contributions are allowed if you’re single and your MAGI is higher than $168,000 or you’re married, filing jointly with a combined MAGI of more than $252,000.

IRA contribution limits

The IRS sets annual IRA contribution limits that are adjusted annually to keep up with inflation. In 2025, you can contribute up to $7,000 to a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or a combination of the two. If you’re 50 or older, you can deposit an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution, bringing your limit to $8,000. In 2026, the contribution limit is $7,500, or $8,600 after your 50th birthday.

Note that contributions can’t exceed your earned income for the year. For example, if you earn $5,000, your maximum IRA contribution for the year is $5,000.

IRA withdrawal rules

A traditional IRA is funded with pre-tax money, so you’ll pay income tax on any withdrawals. If you’re taking a distribution before age 59 ½, a 10% early withdrawal penalty will typically apply, though there are a few exceptions. For example, if you become permanently disabled or you’re taking up to $10,000 for a qualified first-time home buyer purchase, you may be able to avoid the penalty (but not the taxes).

Contributing to a Roth IRA won’t lower your taxable income, but there are more ways to avoid taxes or a penalty on withdrawals. As noted, you can withdraw your contributions at any time without taxes or penalties. You can withdraw earnings without taxes or penalties after you’re 59 ½ and the account has been open for at least five years. As with a traditional IRA, you may be able to avoid the 10% penalty on early withdrawals in some circumstances.

Required minimum distribution (RMD)

Traditional IRAs have mandatory withdrawals called required minimum distributions (RMDs) that begin when you turn 73. The RMD increases to 75 in 2033. RMDs are never required for Roth IRAs during the original account holder's lifetime.

IRA vs 401(k)

IRAs and 401(k)s are both tax-advantaged retirement accounts that can have both pre-tax and Roth tax structures. However, an IRA is an account you open on your own, while a 401(k) is an account you open through your employer. Here are a few other key distinctions between 401(k)s vs. IRAs you’ll want to know.

Note that you don’t have to choose between a 401(k) or IRA, provided that you work for a company that sponsors a 401(k). You are allowed to have both accounts, and you can make 401(k) contributions and traditional IRA contributions in the same year. The only drawback is that your traditional IRA contributions may not be tax deductible. Or, if you meet the Roth IRA income requirements, you can contribute to a 401(k) and a Roth IRA in the same year.

How to choose an IRA

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to choosing an IRA, but here are some factors to consider when you compare and choose a provider:

Costs: Look at all costs associated with the account, including account fees, subscription costs, trading fees, and assets under management (AUM) fees. Also consider any minimum balance and/or opening deposit requirements.

Investment choices: Be sure you know what you can invest your IRA in before you open your account. Many top IRA providers let you invest in a broad range of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and fixed-income products, like certificates of deposit (CDs).

Advisor access: Many providers offer robo-advisors to help you automate your investments, or they provide access to human financial advisors. Think about how much guidance you’ll want when you select an IRA.

User experience and features: Compare each platform’s website and mobile app to determine if it’s relatively easy to use. Also, look at how you can access customer support and whether you’ll have access to research and trading tools that can help you make informed decisions.

How to open an IRA

Opening an IRA is straightforward. Most of the top IRA providers make it easy to open an account online in just a few minutes. If you’re ready to start investing for retirement, follow these steps:

Decide whether you want a Roth or traditional IRA: For most people, this decision boils down to whether you’d prefer to get an upfront tax break (with a traditional IRA) or if you prefer the tax break in retirement (with a Roth IRA). But you’ll also need to consider whether you’re eligible to deduct your traditional IRA contributions, as well as your eligibility for a Roth IRA. Choose a provider: Look for a provider that offers low fees, an easy-to-use platform, and the investment options you want. If you don’t have much money to invest, also consider the provider’s minimum opening deposit. Open the account: You’ll need to provide a few pieces of personal information, like your name, date of birth, Social Security number, and employer. Fund your account: Once you’ve set up your IRA, you’ll need to fund the account to start investing. Your provider will provide the information you need to transfer money to your IRA. Select your investments: Now it’s time to invest your money. If you’re new to investing and you’re not sure where to start, a robo-advisor can automatically invest money for you, assuming your provider offers one. Otherwise, consider an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or a mutual fund that tracks all of the U.S. stock market, like a total stock market fund, or a broad swath of it, like an S&P 500 fund. These funds are diversified with different types of stocks, which is less risky than investing in a few individual stocks. You will also want to hold some cash or government bonds alongside your stock funds as another layer of diversification.

Rollover IRA

If you have a 401(k) or 403(b) from a past employer, rolling it over into an IRA can be a smart move. IRAs tend to have lower fees and more investment options than 401(k)s. Plus, keeping your retirement money in a single account makes things easier to manage and helps you avoid leaving forgotten 401(k) money on the table.

You must follow some IRA rules to avoid an early withdrawal penalty on the rollover. You’ll need to choose an IRA that matches the tax structure (traditional or Roth) of the account you’re rolling over and you must complete the rollover within 60 days.

Initiate the rollover by contacting your former employer’s plan administrator. You can do a direct or indirect rollover – choose direct whenever possible. For a direct rollover, the plan administrator sends the balance directly to your IRA provider. If you opt for an indirect rollover, the plan’s sponsor will cut the check directly to you and withhold 20% for federal taxes. If you don’t deposit those funds to an IRA within 60 days, you could pay more taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you’re younger than 59 ½.

IRA FAQs

What is the deadline to contribute to an IRA?

You have until Tax Day to contribute to an IRA for any tax year. In other words, you can make 2025 contributions until April 15, 2026.

How do IRA loans work?

The IRS prohibits IRA loans. When you withdraw money from a traditional IRA, you have 60 days to re-deposit the money in your IRA or another retirement account. Providers are generally required to withhold 10% of your withdrawal for federal taxes. So if you need $10,000, you’d need to take out $11,000.

If you don’t deposit the money in a retirement account within 60 days, it’s treated as a distribution. You’ll owe any applicable taxes, and a 10% penalty may apply if you’re younger than 59 ½.

Does your money grow in an IRA?

The goal of investing in an IRA is for your money to grow on a tax-deferred basis, but growth ultimately depends on the performance of your investments.

Suppose you invested your IRA money in an S&P 500 index fund for 30 years. The S&P 500, which represents about 80% of the U.S. stock market by value, has historically produced average annual returns of about 10%. If you invested $5,000 a year and earned 10% annual returns, you’d have nearly $910,000 after 30 years – even though you only contributed $150,000 total.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,When is the Fed's next meeting?,"This month, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) — a division of the Federal Reserve responsible for setting monetary policy — will meet again to evaluate the health of the economy and make key decisions regarding the federal funds rate.

In October, the Fed decided to cut its benchmark rate for the second time this year. And many experts believe an additional rate cut is in store before 2025 is over.

These decisions impact not only how the economy functions as a whole but also everyday consumers, as they influence rates on savings accounts, credit cards, mortgages, and more.

Statements and forecasts released during FOMC meetings provide valuable information on the economic outlook. Knowing when the Fed meets to discuss monetary policy and make important decisions can help you get a snapshot of the economy’s overall health and adjust your own financial strategy accordingly.

When is the next Fed meeting?

The FOMC holds eight regularly scheduled meetings per year. Its most recent meeting took place Oct. 28-29 2025. The next one is scheduled for late the second week of December.

Here's the Fed's full meeting schedule for 2025:

January 28-29

March 18-19*

May 6-7

June 17-18*

July 29-30

September 16-17*

October 28-29

December 9-10*

* Meeting associated with a Summary of Economic Projections.

At these meetings, policymakers assess the health of the economy by evaluating economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), gross domestic product (GDP), and the unemployment rate to shape monetary policy.

The minutes of regularly scheduled meetings are released three weeks after the date of the policy decision. The live press conferences held by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are also livestreamed and recorded.

Once each meeting concludes, the FOMC releases its policy decisions at 2 p.m. Eastern time. Then the Fed Chairman holds a press conference at 2:30 p.m.

What to expect from the next Fed meeting

The next meeting is expected to provide Americans with an update on the federal funds rate. The Fed lowered its target rate three times in late 2024, and twice so far in 2025. It issued this statement following the most recent meeting in October:

""In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 3-3/4 to 4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee decided to conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings on December 1. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.""

Experts believe that the Fed will reduce the federal funds rate one more time in 2025, with a strong chance of additional rate cuts in 2026. However, the number and size of these rate cuts remain to be seen.

How often does the Fed meet to change interest rates?

The FOMC holds eight regularly scheduled meetings per year. But this doesn’t necessarily mean the committee will decide to change rates at every meeting. Members assess the economy's performance and the committee adjusts monetary policy accordingly.

Traders are largely focused on economic data this week to gauge the likelihood of a third and final interest-rate reduction in 2025. The data so far has been mixed. After the ADP National Employment Report showed a loss of 32,000 private-sector jobs in November, the Challenger, Gray & Christmas report estimated 71,321 layoffs last month, 24% higher than November 2024. However, initial unemployment claims during the week of Nov. 29 totaled 191,000 — the lowest level in more than three years.

The next clue will be the September PCE inflation report, due later today. Analysts expect to see that prices rose 2.9% over the prior year. A larger increase could complicate the Fed’s efforts to stimulate jobs with lower interest rates.

Gold prices typically rise when interest rates are falling — and when the economic outlook is uncertain.

A gold investment can add stability and inflation protection to your portfolio. But it can also dilute your gains when stock prices are rising quickly. Finding the right balance between gold’s diversification benefits and profiting from growth potential in other assets can be challenging.

No gold: Trade-off is too high

Robert R. Johnson, professor at Creighton University’s Heider College of Business, does not advocate gold investing. In his words, “while having a small position in precious metals may dampen portfolio volatility in the short-run, the tradeoff between slightly dampened volatility and the lost long-term return is certainly not a prudent one, particularly for Gen Z/millennials with long investing time horizons.”

2% to 5% allocation, depending on the situation

Brett Elliott, director of content and SEO at American Precious Metals Exchange (APMEX), recommends setting an allocation that aligns with your investing goals.

Growth-oriented investors may be comfortable with an allocation of 10% or 15%, according to Elliott. But income investors will prefer a smaller position, because gold provides no yield. A 2% to 5% gold allocation can provide some resiliency without an excessive drag on income potential.

Blake McLaughlin, executive vice president at Axcap Ventures, said historical data support a gold allocation of 5% to 8%. “Gold may not offer the outsized return potential of private investments, but the metal holds a set of attributes that are increasingly hard to ignore,” according to McLaughlin. Those attributes include the metal’s resilience amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest.

5% to 15% gold allocation

Thomas Winmill, portfolio manager at Midas Funds, believes most investors will benefit from a long-term gold allocation of 5% to 15%. Winmill specifically advocates investing in gold mining companies through a mutual fund.

Risk tolerance. Keep your allocation percentage low if you tend to panic in volatile cycles. Financial vs. hard assets. Financial assets are stocks and bonds. Hard assets include tangible items like real estate, gold, collectibles, classic cars, and equipment. If you have no home equity and your wealth is primarily in financial assets, you can set your gold allocation higher.

The Federal Reserve recently implemented a series of cuts to the federal funds rate. As a result, deposit interest rates are falling from their historic highs. Still, it's possible to find high-yield savings accounts paying above 4% APY. So, if you’re looking for the best rates available today, here’s a breakdown of where to find them.

This embedded content is not available in your region.

What bank currently has the highest savings interest rate?

Although savings interest rates are elevated by historical standards, the national average rate for savings accounts is still just 0.4%, according to the FDIC. The good news: Top high-yield savings accounts offer more than 10 times the national average.

As of December 5, 2025, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4.3% APY. This rate is offered by SoFi.*

Here is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners:

Remember, it’s important to shop around before opening a savings account. Interest rates vary widely, but there are several banks (in particular, online banks) and credit unions with highly competitive offers.

Do online banks have the best savings account rates?

Online banks operate exclusively via the web. This significantly reduces their overhead costs, so they’re able to pass those savings onto customers in the form of high deposit rates and low fees. In fact, many of the best high-yield savings accounts also come with zero monthly fees or minimum opening deposit requirements. If you’re searching for the best savings interest rates, online banks are a great place to start.

That said, online banks aren’t the only place you can find savings accounts with rates that range between 4% and 5% APY. Credit unions are not-for-profit financial cooperatives and are also known for providing competitive rates and fewer fees. Many credit unions have certain requirements that must be met in order to become a member, though there are some that allow just about anyone to join.

Should you open a savings account?

Savings accounts are one of the safest places you can put your money. They’re insured by the FDIC (or the NCUA in the case of credit unions), which means your deposits are protected up to $250,000 if your financial institution fails. They also can’t lose money due to market fluctuations.

However, a savings account isn’t always the right choice. Although today’s savings interest rates are high by historical standards, they still don’t offer the same returns you could achieve by investing your money in the market. For long-term savings goals such as retirement, you need to invest a bulk of your savings in higher risk (but higher reward) market investments such as stocks, index funds, and mutual funds to reach your target.

But if you’re saving for a shorter-term goal such as a down payment on a home, vacation, or even an emergency fund, a high-yield savings account is one of the best options. That’s especially true if you want to access your money as needed; other types of high-yield deposit accounts, including money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) place more restrictions on how often you can make withdrawals.

Economic data releases and earnings

Investors looking for a straight answer on the health of the labor market will have to keep waiting or once again make sense of mixed signals.

That's especially true as this December morning marks another first Friday of the month without government jobs data — the best labor market gauge we have.

In the meantime, investors and everyone else have to make do with next-best approximations. And by those measures, hints of calm coexist with warning signs as the labor market grinds through DOGE cuts, restructurings, and what the largest corporations see as the dawn of the AI era.

Claims for unemployment insurance dropped to a three-year low, according to a new report from the Labor Department released on Thursday, bolstering the idea that the labor market remains resilient despite a host of challenges.

But 'tis the season for statistical noise.

Initial claims are subject to big swings this time of year, noted Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, so observers don't need to read too much into one week's worth of numbers.

""Still, initial claims have remained in a range consistent with a relatively low pace of job losses despite recent layoff announcements,"" Vanden Houten wrote in a note Thursday.

Meanwhile, she said, continued claims remain at levels consistent with the weak hiring that has defined the current labor market.

Other private sources of employment data show greater trepidation.

Employers announced more than 70,000 layoffs last month, according to a report from the global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, released Thursday. The number of cuts was up 24% from the planned layoffs announced in November 2024 and reached the highest total for the month since 2022.

“Layoff plans fell last month, certainly a positive sign. That said, job cuts in November have risen above 70,000 only twice since 2008: in 2022 and in 2008,” Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in the report.

Earlier this week, private payroll processor ADP found that the economy unexpectedly shed 32,000 private-sector positions last month, with losses concentrated among small- and medium-size businesses.

Should you open a money market account?

Money market accounts can be a great option for short-term savings goals, like building an emergency fund or setting aside money for an upcoming expense. They generally offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts, and they provide easier access to your money compared to some other options like certificates of deposit (CDs).

Money market accounts are also considered low-risk, and they are FDIC-insured up to the standard $250,000 per depositor, per institution. This makes them safer than money market funds, which can be subject to market risk.

However, keep in mind that many money market accounts require a minimum balance to open the account and earn the highest advertised rate. If you can’t maintain this balance, you might incur fees or miss out on the best rates.

And although you can generally access your funds as needed, MMAs may limit the number of transactions you can make each month. If you need frequent access to your money, this might be a consideration.

What are money market interest rates right now?

Currently, the average money market account rate is 0.59%. However, several high-yield accounts pay upwards of 4% or more. If you're considering opening a money market account, be sure to shop around and compare rates.

Where can I get 12% interest?

There is no one account or investment that guarantees a 12% return. However, if your goal is to earn a strong return on your money and grow your wealth significantly, investing in market securities such as stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds is the best strategy for doing so. The stock market returns about 10% per year, on average.

Compared with today’s top CD rates, national averages are much lower. This highlights the importance of shopping around for the best CD rates before opening an account.

Why do online banks have the best CD rates?

Online banks and neobanks are financial institutions that operate solely via the web. That means they have lower overhead costs than traditional brick and mortar banks. As a result, they’re able to pass those savings on to their customers in the form of higher interest rates on deposit accounts (including CDs) and lower fees. If you’re looking for the best CD rates available today, an online bank is a great place to start.

However, online banks aren’t the only financial institutions offering competitive CD rates. It’s also worth checking with credit unions. As not-for-profit financial cooperatives, credit unions return their profits to customers, who are also member-owners. Although many credit unions have strict membership requirements that are limited to those who belong to certain associations or work or live in certain areas, there are also several credit unions that just about anyone can join.

Should you open a CD?

Whether or not you should put your money in a CD depends on your savings goals. CDs are considered a safe and stable savings vehicle — they don’t lose money (in most cases), are backed by federal insurance, and allow you to lock in today’s best rates.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. First, you must keep your money on deposit for the full term, otherwise you’ll be subject to an early withdrawal penalty. If you want flexible access to your funds, a high-yield savings account or money market account might be a better choice.

Additionally, although today’s CD rates are high by historical standards, they don’t match the returns you could achieve by investing your money in the market. If you’re saving for a long-term goal such as retirement, a CD won’t provide the growth you need to reach your savings goal within a reasonable time frame.

HELOC rates: Friday, December 5, 2025

According to Curinos data, the average weekly HELOC rate is 7.44%. This rate is based on applicants with a minimum credit score of 780 and a maximum combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 70%.

Homeowners have an impressive amount of value tied up in their houses — nearly $36 trillion at the end of the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve. That's the largest amount of home equity on record.

With mortgage rates remaining in the low-6% range, homeowners are unlikely to let go of their primary mortgage anytime soon, so selling a house may not be an option. Why give up your 5%, 4% — or even 3% mortgage?

Accessing some of that value with a use-it-as-you-need-it HELOC can be an excellent alternative.

How lenders determine HELOC interest rates

HELOC interest rates are calculated differently from mortgage rates. Second mortgage rates are based on an index rate plus a margin. That index is often the prime rate, which has fallen to 7.00%. If a lender added 0.75% as a margin, the HELOC would have a rate of 7.75%.

Lenders have flexibility with pricing on a second mortgage product, such as a HELOC or home equity loan. Your rate will depend on your credit score, the amount of debt you carry, and the amount of your credit line compared to the value of your home. Shop two or three lenders for the best terms.

National HELOC rates can include ""introductory"" offers that may only last for six months or one year. After that, your interest rate will become adjustable, likely beginning at a substantially higher rate.

How a HELOC works

You don't have to give up your low-rate mortgage to access the equity in your home. Keep your primary mortgage and consider a second mortgage, such as a home equity line of credit.

The best HELOC lenders offer low fees, a fixed-rate option, and generous credit lines. A HELOC allows you to easily use your home equity in any way and in any amount you choose, up to your credit line limit. Pull some out; pay it back. Repeat.

Meanwhile, you're paying down your low-interest-rate primary mortgage like the wealth-building machine you are.

Look for introductory rates, but be aware of a rate adjustment later

Today, FourLeaf Credit Union is offering a HELOC APR of 5.99% for 12 months on lines up to $500,000. That's an introductory rate that will convert to a variable rate later. When shopping for lenders, be aware of both rates. And as always, compare fees, repayment terms, and the minimum draw amount. The draw is the amount of money a lender requires you to initially take from your equity.

The power of a HELOC is tapping only what you need and leaving some of your line of credit available for future needs. You don't pay interest on what you don't borrow.

HELOC rates today: FAQs

What is a good interest rate on a HELOC right now?

Rates vary significantly from one lender to the next. You may see rates from 6% to as much as 18%. It really depends on your creditworthiness and how diligent you are as a shopper.

Is it a good idea to get a HELOC right now?

For homeowners with low primary mortgage rates and a significant amount of equity in their house, it's likely one of the best times to take out a HELOC. You don't give up that great mortgage rate, and you can use the cash drawn from your equity for things like home improvements, repairs, and upgrades. Of course, you can use a HELOC for fun things too, like a vacation — if you have the discipline to pay it off promptly. A vacation is probably not worth taking on long-term debt.

What is the monthly payment on a $50,000 home equity line of credit?

If you withdraw the full $50,000 from a line of credit on your home and pay a 7.50% interest rate, your monthly payment during the 10-year draw period would be about $313. That sounds good, but remember that the rate is usually variable, so it changes periodically, and your payments will increase during the 20-year repayment period. A HELOC essentially becomes a 30-year loan. HELOCs are best if you borrow and repay the balance within a much shorter period of time.","['Hal Bundrick', 'Cfp', 'Laura Grace Tarpley', 'Fri', 'December', 'At Pm Gmt', 'Min Read']"

How mortgage interest rates work

A mortgage interest rate is a fee for borrowing money from your lender, expressed as a percentage. You can choose from two types of rates: fixed or adjustable.

A fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will stay at 6% for the entire 30 years unless you refinance or sell.

An adjustable-rate mortgage locks in your rate for a predetermined amount of time and then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 7/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first seven years, then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 23 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and housing market.

At the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. Your monthly payment toward mortgage principal and interest stays the same throughout the years — however, less and less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.

Which mortgage term length should you get?

A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is a good choice if you want a lower mortgage payment and the predictability that comes with having a fixed rate. Just know that your rate will be higher than if you choose a shorter term, and you will pay significantly more in interest over the years.

You might like a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage if you want to pay off your home loan quickly and save money on interest. These shorter terms come with lower interest rates, and since you’re cutting your repayment time in half, you’ll save a lot in interest in the long run. But you’ll need to be sure you can comfortably afford the higher monthly payments that come with 15-year terms.

Typically, an adjustable-rate mortgage could be good if you plan to sell before the introductory rate period ends. Adjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, then your rate will change after a predetermined amount of time. However, 5/1 and 7/1 ARM rates have similar to (or even higher than) 30-year fixed rates recently. Before getting an ARM just for a lower rate, compare your rate options from term to term and lender to lender.

According to a Nov. 24 report by the Information, Google’s deal with Meta could be worth billions of dollars.

That sent Nvidia’s stock price down 2.5% the day after the report. Nvidia also released a statement on X saying that it was happy for Google’s success, but that Nvidia’s own chips are a generation ahead of the search giant’s offerings.

On Tuesday, Amazon (AMZN) announced the public availability of its Trainium3 chip, saying that it can save up to 50% on training costs for AI software compared to alternatives.

But Google potentially selling its TPUs (tensor processing units) and Amazon providing access to its Trainium3 chips doesn’t necessarily mean that Nvidia is at risk of losing its lead in the AI race anytime soon.

It does, however, mean that Google and Amazon could end up taking their own share of the broader market as the global AI build-out continues to expand and companies look for alternatives to Nvidia amid a rush for its AI chips.

GPUs vs TPUs

One of the main things to understand about the Nvidia versus Google and Amazon debate is that they don’t exactly offer the same products. Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium3 are types of chips called ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits, meaning they’re built to accomplish specific tasks very well.

That means Google and Amazon have developed them to handle certain applications efficiently because the chips were made specifically for those purposes.

“[Google knows] the requirements and they know what trade-offs are most efficient for them,” explained Forrester senior analyst Alvin Nguyen.

“They can make something that works better today for them. Now, it doesn't mean that it's superior to Nvidia in every aspect. But … at least for Google, it will be superior for their needs,” he added.

Nvidia’s chips, meanwhile, are available across multiple cloud platforms, including those from Google and Amazon, as well as Microsoft. The architecture that underpins the chips can also be transferred to different use cases, whether that’s training AI models, running models on robots, powering video games, or helping bring computing capabilities to self-driving car technologies.

Nvidia also has its own line of networking products that it sells to third parties, including Amazon, which will use the company’s NVLink technology alongside its Trainium4 and Graviton CPU chips in its servers, as well as its popular CUDA software.","['Fri', 'December', 'At Am Gmt', 'Min Read']"

The president invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to levy blanket tariffs on goods from other countries. But Congress is the branch of the US government with oversight of taxation and spending — not the president.

As he has publicly braced for the high court's decision, Trump has claimed the ""full benefit"" of tariff policies would take effect soon, arguing that foreign buyers who stockpiled inventory would be forced to buy more goods. Meanwhile, Trump further expanded tariff breaks on Brazilian goods, part of moves to lower costs on some everyday goods as consumers grapple with price struggles.

The push to reduce food prices comes after electoral wins for Democrats across a number of key state and local races where candidates stressed affordability concerns. Trump has also in recent weeks floated the possibility of a tariff ""dividend"" for many Americans in the form of a $2,000 check.

Trump also in recent days floated the possibility of reducing — or completely eliminating — personal income tax.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,"Trump accounts explained: How they work, who qualifies","President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act ushered in many tax changes, including a new saving and investing vehicle for families known as Trump accounts.

As trumpeted in a White House press release in August, Trump accounts are intended to “give the next generation a jumpstart on saving.”

In layman’s terms, they function as a type of tax-deferred savings account for those under 18, and they come with a starter package for any U.S. citizen born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028: a $1,000 deposit from the government. The intended goal is to allow young people access to a tax-deferred investment that will earn and grow and later be used for things like college or buying a first home.

In December 2025, philanthropists Michael and Susan Dell announced $250 contributions to the accounts for 25 million American children 10 and under who live in ZIP codes with median incomes below $150,000, according to a White House press release. The total endowment amounts to about $6.25 billion.

“With additional donations and the $1,000 contribution from this administration, every eligible newborn U.S. citizen is set up for long-term financial security, giving the next generation a meaningful stake in our economy,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote on X.

Trump accounts explained

Trump accounts for kids, per the bill text, are defined as individual retirement accounts that are funded with after-tax dollars. Only people under 18 who have a Social Security number are eligible to open an account. Funds must be invested in a low-cost index fund.

Annual contributions are capped at $5,000, including up to $2,500 in employer contributions, which will not be included as part of the employee’s taxable income. Distributions begin when the beneficiary turns 18 and are generally subject to ordinary income tax.

Projections from the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers estimate that, for a child born in 2026, maximum contributions each year of $5,000 invested in the market with average returns could result in a balance of $303,800 by age 18 and $1,091,900 by age 28. With an annual contribution of $2,500, the balance by age 18 would be $154,800, and $555,000 by 28. Even with no contributions and only the $1,000 from the Treasury, economists project a balance of $5,800 by 18 and $18,100 by 28.

Who qualifies

The accounts are open to anyone who will not turn 18 by the end of the calendar year in which the account is established, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The account holder must also have a Social Security number issued before opening the account. As the holder approaches 18, they can elect to open a rollover Trump account in which the entirety of their balance can be transferred into the rollover account.

U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, have a special benefit — an initial $1,000 funded by the Treasury into any Trump account established under those terms.

How they work

Trump accounts are essentially IRAs meant to be invested in stock mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that mirror the S&P 500 or another American stock index, according to the White House’s fact sheet.

In general, early withdrawals or distributions are not allowed, except in specific instances. These include qualified rollover contributions, distributions of excess contributions over the $5,000 limit, and distributions in the event of the death of the beneficiary.

Once the account holder turns 18, money can be withdrawn without penalty for specific uses, including qualified birth or adoption expenses, disability, disaster recovery, qualified higher education expenses, qualified first-time home buyers, and terminal illness. Withdrawals for other purposes incur a 10% additional tax if made before the beneficiary turns 59½.

After that age, money can be distributed for any purpose without penalty and is taxed as ordinary income.

How to open a Trump account

The enrollment process for Trump accounts is not quite ready, as the IRS just posted a draft Form 4547 in its tax forms. Once finalized, the form can be used to establish an account.

The form asks for the parent or guardian’s information and the child’s name, Social Security number, and home address. Filers can also indicate whether their child qualifies for the $1,000 pilot program contribution.

Form 4547 can be filed at any time, including at the time of an income tax return. The form can either be sent with the e-filed tax return or mailed to the IRS or, starting in mid-2026, submitted digitally through trumpaccounts.gov. Once the form is submitted, from May 2026, the Treasury Department will send information to the filer indicating the authentication process to activate the account.

How Trump account taxes work

Contributions to a Trump account while the beneficiary is still under 18 are not considered income. Certain contributions, like those from the pilot program, qualified general contributions and employer contributions, do not create a basis in the Trump account, while qualified rollover contributions and other contributions will do so once the account is rolled over into a traditional IRA after the 18th birthday of the beneficiary. Withdrawals from the account may be subject to a 10% additional tax on early distributions for IRA accounts, except for certain reasons, like higher education or first home purchases.

Trump accounts vs. other tax-advantaged accounts

Experts interviewed by Yahoo Finance were not convinced that Trump accounts offered a clear advantage over similar options, like a traditional or Roth IRA or a 529 education savings plan.

529s, for example, allow earnings to accumulate and are not subject to federal and state taxes when used for qualified education expenses.

Zach Teutsch, a managing partner at Values Added Financial, said that a family would have to be “shockingly sure” that their child would not attend college to opt for a Trump account instead of a 529 plan.

“The giving kids money aspect is generally good,” Teutsch said. “The account structure seems ill-considered.”

Traditional IRAs offer an up-front tax deduction, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax money, but the dollars are withdrawn tax-free in retirement.

Trump accounts tax the money when it goes in and when it comes out. Additionally, IRAs — both types — offer a greater variety of investment options and higher contribution limits.

What’s also confusing about Trump accounts is that they allow for both after-tax contributions, like individual gifts from family members or parents, as well as pre-tax contributions, like those from employers.

In general, experts say that Trump accounts have significant drawbacks compared to other options.

“It’s not very attractive,” said Ann Reilley, CEO of Alpha Financial Advisors. “It just seems like they’re complicating things for no reason.”","['Elizabeth Djinis', 'Fri', 'December', 'At Am Gmt', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Momentum builds behind effort to force stock-trade ban vote as top GOP sponsor blasts 'the BS',"Impatient with a slow-moving committee process, advocates for a ban on lawmaker stock trading moved this week to force the issue.

A discharge petition was put forth on Tuesday evening by Republican Reps. Anna Paulina Luna and Tim Burchett. It quickly had more than a dozen signatures.

That leaves a long way to go before it reaches the magic number of 218 needed to circumvent Speaker Mike Johnson and force a vote on the measure, yet it was a notable initial show of force, especially as this week's effort is being led by Republicans in apparent open defiance of their speaker.

Combined with high support in Democratic ranks for the proposal, the push could give new energy to an issue that has been stalled for years.

Among the initial wave of 16 signees, ten were Republicans. And at least three of those Republicans — Reps. Elise Stefanik, Gregory Steube, and Michael Lawler — had not previously co-sponsored the underlying bill.

Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, center, is seen on Capitol Hill in September. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) · Kent Nishimura via Getty Images

That bill, the Restore Trust in Congress Act, would ban members of Congress and their spouses, dependent children, and trustees from owning, buying, or selling individual stocks, securities, commodities, or futures. It currently has 104 co-sponsors, with 82 Democrats and 22 Republicans signed on.

""We're tired of the partisan games,"" Luna said in a social media video just after she made the filing, later adding in another post that the discharge petition process was required ""because of the BS on the back end.""

The initial signatories included an array of longtime supporters of a ban, many of whom hail from opposite ends of the political spectrum, including Democrats like Jared Moskowitz of Florida to Republicans like Elijah Crane of Arizona.

The latest move sets up a likely clash with Johnson, who had previously expressed his support of the idea of a ban but told Punchbowl News on Wednesday that members should at least be able to own stocks.

""There's probably a way to do that that still allows for lawful conduct by members,"" he said, adding that he wished Luna hadn't gone the discharge petition route.

This issue is also just one front of trouble for Johnson, who has seen some of his Republican colleagues openly questioning his leadership.

Stefanik is a chair of Speaker Johnson's House Republican leadership team and has dramatically broken with him on a range of issues this week. She even suggested to the Wall Street Journal that Johnson was a ""political novice"" and that he likely wouldn't retain his gavel if new speaker elections were held today.","['Fri', 'December', 'At Am Gmt', 'Min Read']"
None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,A 'K-shaped' economy has investors on edge. BofA says it may hold up.,"A growing chorus on Wall Street is warning that the US economy is becoming increasingly K-shaped, with higher-income households powering spending while lower-income consumers struggle with affordability. It mirrors what investors have seen in the stock market, where Big Tech continues to drive the major indexes even as other sectors lag behind.

The concern: How long can those two realities coexist before something breaks?

“I don't think they're going to coexist forever,” Bank of America senior US economist Aditya Bhave told Yahoo Finance during the firm’s 2026 outlook call this week. “Our view is that the bottom of the K will stabilize before the top of the K collapses. That's underpinning our more optimistic view of the economy.”

BofA now expects 2.4% real GDP growth in 2026, an above-consensus call the bank sees as consistent with the economy avoiding recession.

Bhave admitted the timing “feels counterintuitive,” given the release of softer labor market data.

Planned layoffs hit their highest November level since 2022, according to Challenger, Gray, and Christmas. And private payrolls unexpectedly shed 32,000 jobs in November, with small businesses hit hardest, yet another sign of the Main Street divide.

Still, he said BofA’s view comes down to a simple decision: “The first question is, is there going to be a recession or not? And if our answer to that is no … you're much more likely to grow above 2% than below, which is why we're landing at 2.4%.”

Bhave emphasized that the “haves vs. have-nots” split is real but not necessarily destabilizing in the near term. Higher-income households spend significantly more on services, which dominate the US job market. And despite the mixed signals, one piece of data pointed to ongoing resilience: jobless claims fell to a three-year low on Thursday.

“One reason to be less pessimistic is the following: Who spends more on services — higher- or lower-income folks? It's actually higher-income folks,” he said. “So if you take $1 of spending and you tell me that it was actually spent by a higher-income household … I’ll say that’s more likely to have been spent on services.”

That matters because “5 out of 6 jobs in the US are in services,” Bhave noted. More spending on discretionary services “could actually be more supportive for the labor market” and “increase the chances that the labor market will stabilize.”

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,Retirement planning: A step-by-step guide,"Retirement planning involves estimating how much money you’ll need when you retire and then developing a strategy for saving and investing your money. There’s no magic number, but the goal is to have enough income to live the life you want after you stop working.

If you’re not sure how to start planning — or if you have been contributing money to retirement accounts and want to make the most of your savings — you’re in the right place. This step-by-step guide will provide a roadmap on how to save for retirement.

Step. 1: Budget 15% of your pre-tax salary for retirement savings

A good guideline is to save at least 15% of your pre-tax income in a tax-advantaged retirement account. If your employer matches a portion of your retirement contributions, that contribution counts toward the 15%. This percentage isn’t etched in stone, however, and you may need to adjust your savings rate based on your situation and your goals.

Even if you can’t save 15% initially, you can work your way up to that level over time. The important thing is to get started no matter how small the amount you can afford to save.

The IRS sets annual limits on how much you can contribute to retirement accounts. You can contribute more money, known as catch-up contributions, when you’re 50 or older.

Learn more: How much should I contribute to my 401(k)?

Don’t worry if you can’t afford to contribute the maximum amounts. Focus instead on what you can afford. What’s more, aiming to save 15% isn’t appropriate for everyone.

When you may need to save more than 15%

You’re getting a late start on saving for retirement.

You’re planning on early retirement.

In either scenario, you may need to save more aggressively because you have less time to benefit from compounding. Compounding happens when your investment earnings generate more earnings. This process expedites your investment growth over time, creating more earnings potential the longer you stay invested.

When you have less time to save, your money has less time to compound, so you may need to save more to reach your retirement goals.

When you may want to save less than 15%

You have high-interest debt, like a credit card balance: Credit card interest rates are substantially higher than the returns you can earn from your investment accounts in an average year. Paying down credit card debt first may save you more money than you’d typically earn from investing returns.

You don’t have an emergency fund: Try to build a three-month fund that you keep in a high-yield savings account. If you don’t have emergency savings, you could be forced to withdraw retirement funds if you lose your job or get sick. That can be costly because, barring special circumstances, you will likely owe taxes and a 10% penalty on early withdrawals before the age of 59½. The long-term impact is even worse when you consider the lost compounding opportunity. Your money has less time to grow when you withdraw from investments early.

No. 2: Pick your retirement accounts

Here’s a breakdown of your retirement account options.

The most common type of employer-sponsored retirement plan is the 401(k). However, if you work for the government or a nonprofit, you may have another type of retirement plan, like a 403(b) or a 457(b) plan.

Learn more: 403(b) vs. 401(k): Similarities, differences, advantages, and disadvantages

Many employers match a portion of employee contributions to these retirement accounts. For example, your company may match 50% of your contributions up to 6% of your salary. In this scenario, you’d contribute at least 6% to get the full match. If you contribute 6%, your employer contributes 3%, bringing your total contribution rate to 9%.

If your employer matches some of your contributions, make it a priority to get the entire match. Otherwise, you’re passing up free money.

Learn more: How a 401(k) match works and why you should seek it out

Individual retirement accounts (IRAs)

An IRA is a retirement account that isn’t tied to an employer. You can open an IRA regardless of whether you have a workplace plan. You’ll need income from working (like a salary, hourly wages, tips, commissions, or self-employment income) during the tax year to contribute.

IRAs have virtually unlimited investment options and usually have lower fees than 401(k)s. If you don’t have access to a workplace plan or your employer doesn’t match contributions, an IRA can be a good way to start saving. The downside is that annual IRA contribution limits are much lower than 401(k) limits.

Learn more: These are the traditional IRA and Roth IRA limits

Self-employed retirement plans

There are several retirement plans available for self-employed people, such as a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP), SIMPLE IRA, and Solo 401(k).

Roth vs. traditional accounts

IRAs are available as traditional or Roth accounts. Many workplace retirement plans also offer these two options. The difference boils down to how you’re taxed and eligibility.

Contributions to traditional 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are made with pre-tax dollars, meaning that the money you deposit in these accounts will often lower your taxes for the current year. However, you will owe taxes once you begin taking your distributions in retirement.

Contributions to Roth 401(k)s and Roth IRAs are made with after-tax dollars. There’s no upfront tax break, but if you wait until you’re 59½ and you’ve had the account for five years, your distributions will be tax-free.

Both traditional and Roth retirement accounts defer annual taxes on your investment income. This is different from a taxable account, which requires you to pay taxes on interest, dividends, and realized capital gains in the year they are earned.

Roth IRAs also give you the flexibility to withdraw all of your contributions (but not the earnings) at any time without paying taxes or a penalty. This is best avoided, though, unless you’re facing a financial crisis. Note that income limits apply to Roth IRAs, so you may not be eligible to contribute if your earnings are high.

No. 3: Decide how to prioritize contributions to retirement accounts

Once you’ve selected your retirement accounts, you’ll have to decide how to allocate your money. Here’s a good way to prioritize:

Strive to contribute enough to get your employer’s match on your 401(k) contributions.

If you have extra money to save, aim to max out a Roth IRA, if you meet the income requirements, or a traditional IRA. If you don’t qualify for an employer-sponsored plan with a match, start with the Roth IRA.

After you’ve maxed out available IRA contributions, use extra money to make unmatched 401(k) contributions. You could also invest extra money in a brokerage account. Taxable accounts don’t qualify for tax-deferred earnings, but they don’t have withdrawal restrictions either.

Your contributions then need to be invested. Many employer plans have a relatively limited number of investment options, which are usually mutual funds. One easy option is to go with a target-date fund, which bases your investments on your estimated retirement date. IRAs have much broader investment access. Depending on the account, you may be able to invest in individual stocks, funds, bonds, and even real estate.

Many brokerages offer robo-adviser services, which use algorithms to decide how to invest the money in your IRA.

No. 4: Give your Social Security account a checkup

Social Security is another important part of your retirement plan. To see an estimate of your future retirement benefit and verify that Social Security’s record of your earnings is accurate, create a Social Security account at ssa.gov.

While you’re at it, brush up on the basic Social Security rules:

You’re eligible for 100% of your benefit at full retirement age, which is 67 if you were born in 1960 or later.

You can claim retirement benefits as early as 62, but you’ll receive a reduced benefit.

You can hold out for a larger benefit until age 70, at which point your benefit maxes out.

Your benefit is based on your 35 highest-earning years.

Learn more: Social Security payment schedule

No. 5: Increase your savings over time

When you’re beginning your career, you may not have much money to save for retirement. Focus on getting your employer’s 401(k) match when you’re starting out. But make it your goal to save more as your income increases or you pay down debt.

Budgeting for future financial milestones can help you achieve this step. Try layering in a bit more savings whenever your income increases or you cut an expense. For example, you could decide to allocate 25% of your next pay bump to your retirement accounts. Or, once you pay off your credit card or car loan, put the money that went toward monthly payments into your 401(k) or IRA.

No. 6: Work with a financial advisor, as needed

Once you’ve been saving for a while, working with a financial advisor may be worthwhile. A financial adviser can evaluate your investing activities to determine if you’re on track to meet your goals. Advisors can also project different scenarios to show you how saving more, investing differently, or changing your retirement timeline may be appropriate.

Questions to ask while retirement planning

Consider the following questions as part of your retirement planning process:

How much money should I contribute to retirement accounts?

How much money do I need to retire?

What sources of income will I have?

When should I take Social Security benefits?

Where do I want to live?

At what age will I retire?

What kind of lifestyle do I want?

If these questions feel hard to answer now, don’t worry, they’ll get easier as you go through the process of retirement planning.

Learn more: What is the retirement age for Social Security, 401(k), and IRA withdrawals?

In the early stages, your goals may be vague. You may only know that you want to stop working someday, but you’re not sure how, where, or when. That’s enough information to help you focus on setting aside savings and investing that money appropriately — and that’s true no matter how much money you’re able to save.

As retirement draws closer, you’ll be in a better position to make specific plans, such as deciding where you want to live, when you’ll quit working, and when you’ll start receiving Social Security benefits.

How much money do you need to retire?

Retirement planning is personal, and the amount of money you need will depend on the factors listed above, along with some things you have less control over, including your healthcare needs and how long you live.

So, how much do you need? An often-cited piece of conventional wisdom indicates that you should plan to replace up to 80% of your pre-retirement income once you’ve retired. Other estimates say 70% or less.

Fidelity advises people save between 55% and 80% of their pre-retirement income to maintain their lifestyle, but that percentage can be as low as 45% if you’re “saving 15% each year from age 25 to 67.”

Recommendations like these can provide an estimate for planning purposes, but the actual amount you need to retire is personal to you and depends on many factors, including your lifestyle and where you want to live after you stop working. For example, if you live frugally and retire debt-free, you’ll need less money than if you plan to travel extensively or own multiple residences.

Best retirement investments

You can earn your targeted retirement income from different sources. Common options include:

Distributions from retirement accounts, including a 401(k) and individual retirement account (IRA)

Social Security benefits

Pension

Investment income from dividends or real estate

Earnings from a part-time job

Your investing efforts in your working years can fund a 401(k), IRA, real estate purchases, or a taxable brokerage account. Depending on your age and risk tolerance, investments you might consider for your retirement and taxable accounts include:

Individual company stocks: You can usually hold these in IRAs and taxable brokerage accounts.

Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds or ETFs: 401(k)s, IRAs, and taxable brokerage accounts generally have access to a range of funds, each with its own investment strategy.

Target-date funds: Target-date funds own a mix of different investment types, like stocks and bonds. These funds adjust their holdings so that your risk declines as you approach your retirement date. They are meant to be held alone as the only asset in your portfolio.

Target-risk funds: Target-risk funds also have different types of assets, but they maintain a consistent risk level over time.

REITs: REITs, or real estate investment trusts, are companies that own and manage real estate. They earn on rents and property appreciation.

When to retire

Your targeted retirement age is another important consideration. Retiring early may be the dream, but it can strain your finances. When you retire early, you have less time to save, and you need more money.

Plan retirement now, adjust as needed

The sooner you start planning and saving, the better your odds of achieving a comfortable retirement. Remember, every dollar counts. Even if you can only save a few hundred dollars initially, that money will have time to grow and benefit you down the road thanks to the power of compounding.

Expect your retirement goals to evolve. Your plans will probably be vague when you’re in your 20s and 30s. But over time, you’ll get a better sense of what your retirement needs will be.

Retirement planning FAQ

What is retirement planning?

For many people, retirement planning is a multi-decade process of preparing for the day when they no longer get a paycheck from their job. The earlier you start thinking about and planning for retirement, the more likely you are to have built up enough savings to live comfortably after you stop working. Even if you’re already in your 50s and can set aside only a small amount periodically, it’s important to remember that even small amounts help.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,I went on a one-week spending freeze and saved $200. Here’s how you can too.,"As a personal finance writer, I’m often thinking about new and creative ways to save money. This year, especially, I need to be careful about my spending and saving habits because I’m about six months away from my wedding. I’m taking any and every opportunity to save for the big day.

That’s why I recently embarked on a weeklong spending freeze, which helped me save an extra $200. Here’s what I learned, and how you can do it too.

What is a spending freeze?

A spending freeze is simple: You choose a period of time during which you spend as little as possible to give your savings a boost.

You can customize the details and parameters of the challenge to fit your lifestyle. For example, it may not be feasible to spend no money at all. Maybe your rent is due, or you need to fill your gas tank to get to work. The point of a spending freeze is to cut out discretionary spending while still ensuring your essentials are covered.

Read more: What is a no-spend challenge, and is it right for you?

Setting myself up for the challenge

Before embarking on my spending freeze, I had to take steps to set myself up to thrive and not accidentally break my freeze. Here’s what I did.

Set a goal

The first thing I did was set a goal for myself. Admittedly, my goal was a bit ambiguous since I wasn’t trying to save for one particular thing. I simply wanted to be able to put a bit more money into my savings account this month.

I decided to start with a flexible goal of saving $200. When setting this goal, I estimated how much money I might spend in a week on discretionary purchases, plus how much I could potentially save by cutting down the costs of certain essentials. I felt pretty confident that I could reach my goal by making a few smarter choices.

Created my personal rules

I set certain rules for myself, taking into account some major expenses I had already scheduled. This included wedding vendor payments that I’d need to make during the week. I also decided to keep the freeze flexible when it came to fuel because my household fuel needs and costs can vary from week to week.

Anticipated curve balls

From running out of toilet paper to chipping in for a friend’s bachelorette party, I tried to anticipate every surprise expense, no matter how big or small, that could potentially throw me off my spending freeze and planned accordingly.

I went grocery shopping ahead of time to make sure I had plenty of sustenance available at home and was stocked up on any household supplies I may need. Buying in bulk is often touted as a way to save, but I don’t do it often because there are only two people in my household, and I’ve found that most things will expire before we have a chance to eat it all.

However, this particular week, I made sure to stock up on nonperishables and household items. When calculating the cost per unit, buying in bulk not only helped me save money but also afforded me a few more weeks of not having to worry about grocery shopping.

It’s impossible to predict every expense that could come up, but I tried to be conscious of my day-to-day expenses, as well as one-off expenses that were on the horizon.

I’m proud to say that I managed to make it through the entire week without spending any money that I hadn’t accounted for and set aside ahead of time.

Timed it right

It’s important to choose a time for your spending freeze that doesn’t align with a big spending period. For example, choosing to do a spending freeze the week of a significant other’s birthday or the week of a major holiday probably isn’t the best idea.

Before deciding on when and how long my spending freeze would go on, I had to do a bit of pre-planning to find a time that worked best for me.

My experience and best tips for sticking to a spending freeze

Ultimately, the spending freeze challenge was a good financial reset for me. The end of the year is typically when I face many “out of the norm” expenses, like a last-minute outfit for a holiday party or holiday hosting costs. And this year, there is some added pressure on my budget with a major life milestone just a few months away.

Overall, I found the experience to be refreshing. Although I wouldn’t say it was difficult, it definitely required me to think outside the box. At the end of the week, I saved about $200 that I would have otherwise spent on discretionary expenses.

Some of the key ways I saved money included:

Making my morning coffee at home

I know this can be controversial. Although I’m never going to shame anyone for buying coffee at a coffee shop, a few dollars each day does add up — maybe not enough to cover a mortgage payment, but every little bit matters for me right now.

Over the course of a week, I used about half a canister of instant coffee, which chalks up to about $5 worth. I don’t typically go to a coffee shop every day, but had I stopped by my usual spot, I would have spent about $7 for a latte each time.

Trading takeout for at-home meals

It’s not uncommon for my husband and me to order food once or twice per week. However, between meal delivery app upcharges, tips, and fees, takeout for the two of us can easily range from $30 to $60 per meal.

That doesn’t mean we slaved away in the kitchen each night. Instead, I shopped around ahead of time for frozen meals that felt a bit more like a treat, but didn’t cost nearly as much as delivery.

Taking advantage of money-saving memberships

Experts often advise you to cancel memberships as a way to save money. And I’m in full agreement if these membership fees strain your budget and you don’t use the membership enough to justify paying for it.

However, there are instances when certain memberships essentially pay for themselves through the savings they provide. For instance, my husband and I have a monthly movie theater membership that allows us to see up to four free movies each week. In fact, the monthly cost of the membership is less than the cost of buying tickets to two movies, so it more than pays for itself quickly. We were able to enjoy two free date nights during my spending freeze.

We also have a Costco membership that we use to purchase items such as toilet paper, paper towels, cereal, and other nonperishables in bulk to save on the per-unit cost. I can stock up on these ahead of time to avoid making one-off trips to the store and paying top dollar.

Making some extra cash and cutting recurring expenses

The same week I did my spending freeze, I also looked for ways to generate a bit of extra income and kill some time by clearing out my closet. I managed to sell an old lamp and some outdoor furniture cushions that added an additional $80 to my savings that week.

I also looked for ways to trim my monthly costs. One evening, my husband and I went through all of our streaming subscriptions to either keep, cancel, or downgrade our memberships. We ended up downgrading two of our streaming subscriptions to more basic plans with advertisements to save about $20 per month moving forward.

Looking for free activities

In a typical week, it’s not unusual for me to have at least one social event on the calendar. So, I wanted to challenge myself to find ways to get out of the house and do something without spending any money.

There were plenty of free events and places to visit in my area. I spent an afternoon with my dog at the dog park, walked around a local farmer’s market to get some ideas for potential holiday gifts, spent a day at my apartment complex pool, and had a movie night at a friend’s house. There was no shortage of enjoyable (free) things to do; it was just a matter of taking that extra step to do the research and make a plan.

Bottom line

I managed to give my savings a decent boost by taking on this challenge, and ultimately, this will help me get a bit closer to reaching my personal goals.

It’s not lost on me that a weeklong spending freeze can be a pretty big commitment and might deter some people from taking on the challenge. However, you can give this type of challenge a try by taking baby steps. Even designating one day each week as a no-spend day could help you save a bit more each month. Eventually, you can work your way up to a seven-day spending freeze or even longer.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped almost 0.1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged up 0.2%. The moves came on the heels of small closing gains for Wall Street stocks.

Meta (META) led tech higher, with shares up over 3% as a report said CEO Mark Zuckerberg planned to make steep cuts to the company's metaverse unit. Nvidia (NVDA) also gained, rising over 2%.

Overall, Wall Street is under growing conviction that the Fed will shift toward easing at its policy meeting next week, fueled by support from key officials and a lackluster run of economic data. Traders are pricing in an 89% probability of a rate cut, per CME FedWatch, after a softer-than-expected ADP reading on private employment.

Speculation that Kevin Hassett will replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair is playing into longer-term expectations for lower rates. The White House's top economic advisor is seen as likely to usher in a more dovish era at the Fed, given his backer President Trump's aggressive campaign for rapid cuts. But markets are said to be doubtful about Hassett, and bond investors have reportedly voiced concerns to the US Treasury.

Further clues to the state of the labor market came Thursday, with jobless claims unexpectedly falling to a three-year low. But another report found that last month was the worst November for corporate layoffs in three years. On the inflation side, investors will on Friday get the September PCE reading on consumer prices — the Fed's preferred gauge.

Meanwhile, with earnings season in its final stretch, Salesforce (CRM) shares popped after the business software maker posted a raised outlook that both topped analyst expectations. Snowflake (SNOW) stock tumbled after the AI data cloud provider's revenue guidance fell short.

None,https://finance.yahoo.com/,FSA vs. HSA: Which account is best for you?,"Health savings accounts (HSAs) and flexible spending accounts (FSAs), also known as healthcare flexible spending arrangements (HCFSAs), let you save for eligible medical expenses with pre-tax dollars. You generally can’t have both types of accounts, so read on to learn the details of each to decide which, if either, is best for you.

HSAs and FSAs explained

Both HSAs and healthcare FSAs cover qualified medical expenses that generally include the costs to treat, manage, or prevent a physical or mental condition not covered by your health insurance. Common costs include deductibles, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, eyeglasses, hearing aids, weight loss programs, and more.

For both accounts, your contributions and withdrawals are tax-free. However, each program has eligibility requirements and other rules to follow to take advantage of its benefits.

What to know about an HSA

Eligibility: To open an HSA, you need a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). An HDHP generally requires a lot of money up front before your health insurance starts to pay, which is why an HSA comes in handy.

You can open an HSA at a bank, credit union, or insurance company, or go through your employer if offered.

Contributions: You can fund an HSA through your employer using pre-tax payroll deductions. If you have an account outside your employer, you’ll deduct your HSA contributions when you file your income tax return.

For tax year 2025, individuals can contribute up to $4,300 and families up to $8,550. If you’re aged 55 to 65, the IRS allows an extra $1,000 as a catch-up contribution. Employer contributions count toward the annual limit.

For tax year 2026, an individual can contribute up to $4,400, and a family up to $8,750.

Reimbursements: Some HSA plans come with a debit card you can use to pay for eligible healthcare costs. Without a card, you’ll likely pay out of pocket and request a funds transfer to your bank account.

Rollovers: Your HSA funds roll over from year to year and follow you even if you leave your employer. Money in an HSA can earn tax-free interest, and you may also be able to invest a portion of your HSA once you’ve reached a savings threshold.

What to know about an FSA

Eligibility: You can only get an FSA through your employer. They’re currently not available to self-employed individuals. If an FSA is part of your employee benefits plan, you can usually enroll regardless of your health plan.

You usually can’t have an FSA and an HSA, unless it’s a limited-purpose FSA, which covers care outside your primary health plan, like vision and dental expenses.

Contributions: Employers use payroll deductions to fund your FSA. Your contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income and, ultimately, your tax bill. The individual annual contribution limit is $3,300 for tax year 2025. Each spouse can contribute to their employer’s FSA for an annual limit of $6,600 for the household if married and filing jointly.

Reimbursements: Pay for your eligible expenses with an FSA debit card or pay out of pocket and submit a claim for reimbursement. Distributions are tax-free for qualified medical expenses.

Rollovers: Money in a healthcare FSA does not roll over from year to year. You generally need to use all of your funds by the end of the year, or you’ll forfeit them to your employer. Employers can offer a grace period of up to 2 ½ months or a carryover of up to $660 into 2026.

HSA vs. FSA: Which is best?

In order to decide if an HSA or FSA is best for you, you’ll need to look at your health insurance premiums and deductibles as well as your overall health and anticipated expenses.

Consider an HSA if you’re generally healthy

HSAs require a high-deductible health plan. An HDHP could have lower premiums than a traditional health plan, but you’ll pay more up front before insurance kicks in. If you anticipate frequent care, you could foot the bill for costs that far exceed your HSA contribution limit. On the other hand, if you don’t think you’ll need a lot of medical care throughout the year, you could save on an HSA by taking advantage of lower health plan premiums and an HSA balance that carries over.

Explore an FSA if you expect near-term medical expenses

An FSA is a use-it-or-lose-it plan, so try to use your funds within the year. If you tend to have high medical expenses, you may find even more savings with an FSA since it doesn’t require a high-deductible health plan. Unlike an HSA, you can qualify for an FSA with any of your employer’s health insurance plans, even those with lower deductibles.

FSA vs. HSA FAQs

Who is eligible for HSAs and FSAs?

Individuals with a high-deductible health plan are eligible for an HSA. FSAs are only offered through an employer, so you’ll need to work for an employer that provides one.

Can I have both an HSA and an FSA?

You generally cannot have an HSA with a healthcare FSA unless it’s a limited-purpose FSA. With a limited-purpose FSA, you can save for medical costs your main insurance does not cover, like dental and vision expenses.

Which is better — HSA or FSA?

You could benefit from an HSA if you’re generally healthy and are comfortable with a high-deductible health plan, since you’ll need to be enrolled in one to qualify.

FSAs may be a better fit if you expect medical costs within the year. If you don’t use the funds, they’re gone at the end of the year. It’s best to look at your anticipated medical expenses and what you’ll pay in deductibles for the year to see which account is best for you.","['Trea S.

This was the latest set of tariffs to be announced impacting the furniture industry, after Trump posted last week about a flurry of tariffs on kitchen cabinets, vanities, and other upholstered products on that will take effect Oct. 1.

Trump said the lumber tariffs will help ""strengthen supply chains"" and ""bolster industrial resilience."" Yet home builders have warned this could deter investments in new homes and renovations. Canada is also set to be hit hard by the order, as it's the US's largest wood supplier and already subject to duties of over 35%.

Earlier Monday, Trump said he would impose 100% tariffs on foreign films and ""substantial"" duties on furniture imports, part of a revived tariff blitz in recent days.

Other planned new tariffs include pharmaceuticals, including a 100% duty on patented drugs unless the producer builds a plant in the US or the country has a trade deal that covers drugs. Pfizer (PFE) on Tuesday announced it had received a three-year reprieve from those tariffs as part of a deal with the administration to sell some drugs at a discounted rate, prompting speculation of similar deals to come.

Elsewhere, the US and China have made progress toward various contours of a broader deal following a call between Trump and China's President Xi Jinping. Trump said after that call that the countries had reached an agreement to spin off the TikTok app in the US.

Trump said the two leaders plan to conduct a series of meetings in the coming months, as Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported.

The Wall Street investment bank said companies like Nvidia are compelling, with more room to run. Other buy-rated names screened by CNBC Pro include: Dick's Sporting Goods , Wynn Resorts, Monster Beverage and Genius Sports. Wynn Goldman says the casino and resort company is firing on all cylinders. Analyst Lizzie Dove added the stock to the firm's prestigious conviction buy list earlier this week. Dove said Wynn has the right access to attractive the most affluent travelers. ""WYNN is exposed to the highest-end customer on the strip,"" she wrote. The firm is also bullish on the company's opportunity overseas. ""The launch of Wynn Al Marjan in the UAE in 1Q27, plus WYNN's best-in-class Las Vegas assets, leverage to a higher-income consumer, a strong 2026 Las Vegas event calendar, and an improving backdrop in Macau should drive transformative upside at WYNN,"" she went on to say. The stock is up 46% this year. Dick's Sporting Goods Shares of the sporting goods company have plenty of room to run, according to the firm. Analyst Kate McShane urged investors to remain calm following Dick's recent earnings report. McShane sees a robust industry backdrop for sporting goods and praised the company's relationships with vendors as well its competitive chops. The firm did admit that investors remain conflicted surrounding the company's acquisition of Foot Locker, but said most investors it speaks with are bullish on the transaction. However, shares of the company are up 2% this year.

2025-12-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Dollar General tops list of most overbought stocks this week that are due for a pullback,"A range of retail, financial services and artificial intelligence stocks may soon slide, according to one of the popular yardsticks used in technical analysis. Stocks rose on Friday , advancing for a fourth straight day and approaching all-time highs as the year draws to a close. The S & P 500 added 0.3% this past week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9%. The latest rally, ahead of an expected quarter-point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve at its last meeting of the year next week, is sending some of the best performers to the point where they're looking overbought. In an attempt to find the stocks that have run the farthest and the fastest, and may now be overextended, we used the CNBC Pro stock screener to identify those companies with 14-day relative strength index (RSI) values above 70 — a threshold suggesting future weakness — and weekly gains of at least 5%. Stocks such as Dollar General , mobile technology provider AppLovin and Wells Fargo were among the stocks that turned up as most overbought. Here are some that could see their shares stumble: Dollar General topped the list of overbought stocks with an RSI of 85. Its shares jumped nearly 17% last week through midday Friday after it raised its same-store sales, earnings and revenue forecasts for 2026. AppLovin shares also appear overbought, with an RSI of 71.4. The $235 billion market cap rallied nearly 15% in the five days though midday Friday, and has now more than doubled in 2025. The gains come after the mobile advertising technology company last week forecast multi-year growth in the market for gaming advertising. AppLovin said the gains would be fueled by enhancements to its mobile advertising and app monetization platforms. Oversold After the market's latest move higher, fewer stocks screen as oversold, but there are a handful, the CNBC Pro stock screener shows. Oversold stocks have RSIs below 30 and lost 5% or more last week, again as of midday Friday. W R Berkley topped the stocks that may be set up for a near-term bounce. The property and casualty insurer has an RSI of 20.2 after its stock slumped 9% on the week. Alexandria Real Estate Equities, a real-estate investment trust with an RSI of 25.3, is unloved after its stock slumped about 13% last week in reaction to it slashing its quarterly dividend 46%. The Pasadena, California property owner also reduced its 2026 funds from operations per share outlook to a range of $6.25 to $6.55, below analysts' consensus estimate of $6.88, according to FactSet.",['Liz Napolitano']

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.) Just before Warren Buffett surprised shareholders in early May with his plan to step down as CEO at the end of the year, Berkshire Hathaway's B shares were outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 by 22.4 percentage points in 2025. Over the following three months, BRKB fell 14.9% to a post-meeting closing low of $459.11 on August 4. Since that date, it has rebounded by 9.9% to close at $504.34, up 11.3% year-to-date.

But it hasn't been enough to catch up with the S&P's 37.9% surge since its closing low of the year of 4982.77 on April 8. After a four-day winning streak, the index ended today at 6870.40, just 20 points below its all-time closing high in late October, and up 16.8% year-to-date.

So, with 17 trading days remaining in 2025, and 26 calendar days until Greg Abel takes over as Berkshire's CEO, Berkshire's B shares are trailing the S&P by 5.5 percentage points. They had been down 12.2 percentage points on October 29 and came with 0.6 percentage points of drawing even on November 20.

This isn't the full story, however, because Buffett likes to compare Berkshire's stock performance to the S&P with dividends included. That gives the index another 1.4 percentage points for a total YTD gain of 18.2%, almost 7 percentage points ahead of Berkshire.

Melinda French Gates: Giving Pledge is a work in progress

Melinda French Gates says The Giving Pledge, which she launched in 2010 along with Bill Gates, her former husband, and Warren Buffett has more work to do to achieve Buffett's goal of changing ""the norm around what is expected of people with great wealth."" The Pledge's website says that ""more than 250 of the world's wealthiest philanthropists"" have promised to ""give the majority of their wealth to charitable causes in their lifetime or wills.""

Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, participates in a panel titled “Digital Public Infrastructure: Stacking Up the Benefits” at the 2023 Spring Meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, April 14, 2023. Elizabeth Frantz | Reuters

In an appearance on Wired's ""The Big Interview"" podcast this week, French Gates said, ""I wish we had been even more successful with the pledge than we have been to date; it's a problem to continue working on."" Have those making the pledge been ""actually giving money?"" ""Some of them, yes, some of them at massive scale, and we are trying to demonstrate through the pledge that you can give at massive scale. But have they given enough? No. You know, some are doing it, and some are trying or aren't ready to."" She acknowledged a key problem is getting very wealthy people to begin giving away their money, in part because ""it takes a while to know which organizations you can trust to be effective with your money."" And if you create your own vehicle, ""Who do I hire that I can trust so that it stays with my values, my mission?"" ""There are a lot of barriers that keep people from starting, but we know what they are. Once you start, you can build a flywheel and then we're trying to demonstrate for them: Go big. You can go big, you can go bold."" VIDEO: In 2018, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation co-chair and co-founder Melinda Gates sat down with CNBC's Becky Quick to discuss how the foundation was aiming to improve global health and eliminate poverty. In August, a report from the Institute for Policy Studies argued the Giving Pledge is ""unfulfilled, unfulfillable, and not our ticket to a fairer, better future,"" with many early pledgers getting ""far wealthier since they signed."" A Giving Pledge spokesperson called the report ""misleading"" with incomplete data that excludes ""significant forms of charitable giving,"" including contributions to foundations.

BUFFETT AROUND THE INTERNET

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE ARCHIVE

Buffett on evaluating 'moats' (1999) Warren Buffett explains why it's important to look at what he calls a company's ""moat,"" its ability to maintain an advantage over competitors.

watch now

AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'd like you to drill down with us and tell us what, to you, are the signs of great management and economic moats... WARREN BUFFETT: The moat and the management are part of the valuation process, in that they enter into our thinking as to the degree of certainty that we attribute to the stream of income — stream of cash, actually — that we expect in the future and the amount of it. I mean it is, you know, it is — it's an art, in terms of valuation of businesses. The formulas get simple at the end. But if you and I were each looking at the chewing gum business — we own no Wrigley, so I use Wrigley fairly often in class — pick a figure that you would expect unit growth of chewing gum, you know, to grow in the next 10 or 20 years. Give me your expectations on how much pricing flexibility you have, how much danger there is that Wrigley's share of market is dramatically reduced. You can go through all of that. That's what we go through. That is — and in the — in that case, we are evaluating the moat. We are evaluating the price elasticity, which interacts with the moat in certain ways. We're evaluating the likelihood of unit demand changing in the future. We're evaluating the likelihood of the management being either very bright with the cash that they develop or being very stupid with it. And all of that gets into our evaluation of what that stream of money looks like over the years. But the value of — how the investment will — works out depends on how that stream develops over the next 10 or 20 years... If you have a big enough moat, you don't need as much management. You know, it gets back to Peter Lynch's remark that he likes to buy a business that's so good that an idiot can run it, because sooner or later one will. Well — (Laughter) That's — I mean, he was saying the same thing. I mean, he was saying that what he really likes is a business with a terrific moat where nothing can happen to the moat. And there aren't very many businesses like that. But then — so you get involved in evaluating all these shadings. This [a can of Coca-Cola], not the cherry version, but the regular version — this one, has a terrific moat around it. There's a moat even in this, you know, in the container. You know, I — there was some study made as to what percentage of the people could identify blindfolded what product they were holding just by grabbing the container. And there aren't many that could score like Coca-Cola in that respect. So here you've got a case where that product has a share of mind. If there's 6 billion people in the world — I don't know what percentage of them have something in their mind that's favorable about Coca-Cola, but it would be a huge number. And the question is, 10 years from now is that number even larger, and is the impression just a slight bit more favorable, on average, for those billions of people that have it? And that's what the business is all about.

2025-12-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Barrick Mining stock has more than doubled in 6 months. Why Elliott's activism could drive more upside,"Business: Barrick Mining , formerly Barrick Gold Corporation, is a gold and copper producer, which is engaged in the production and sale of gold and copper, as well as related activities, such as exploration and mine development. It has ownership interests in producing gold mines in Argentina, Canada, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania and the United States. Its copper mines are in Zambia, Chile and Saudi Arabia. Its operations include Nevada Gold Mines, Bulyanhulu, Hemlo, Jabal Sayid, Kibali, Loulo-Gounkoto, Lumwana, North Mara, Porgera, Pueblo Viejo, Tongon, Veladero and Zaldivar. Its Bulyanhulu operation is located in northwest Tanzania, over 55 kilometers south of Lake Victoria and 150 km southwest of the city of Mwanza. The Jabal Sayid copper operation is located 350 km northeast of Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Lumwana copper mine is a conventional open pit operation.

Activist: Elliott Investment Management

Ownership: n/a

Average Cost: n/a

Activist Commentary: Elliott is a multistrategy investment firm that manages about $76.1 billion in assets (as of June 30, 2025) and is one of the oldest firms of its type under continuous management. Known for its extensive due diligence and resources, Elliott regularly follows companies for years before making an investment. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies.

What's happening

On Nov. 18, Elliott announced a position in Barrick Mining and expressed its interest in seeing a potential separation of North American assets from its mines in riskier regions across Asia and Africa. Most recently, on Dec. 1, Barrick announced that the board has authorized the company to explore a potential separation of the North American assets.

Behind the scenes

Barrick Mining is a Toronto-based global mining company focused predominantly on gold, operating 14 gold mines, as well as three additional cooper mines. The core of this business is its North America Gold assets, which consists of some of the highest quality deposits in the world, specifically Nevada Gold Mines, a joint venture with Newmont in which Barrick owns 61.5% and serves as its operator. The company also operates gold mines in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. Its copper portfolio is centered around Africa and the Middle East, including Reko Diq, a new copper development project in Pakistan.

With the recent bull market for gold, Barrick's stock has more than doubled over the past six months. Despite this, Barrick continues to trade at 0.9 times its price to net asset value ratio, a significant discount to North American peers, who trade well above 1x, with best-in-class peers like Agnico Eagle trading at approximately 1.5x.

Investors buy gold companies primarily for gold price exposure, and from there prefer the companies with the best management teams that operate the companies most efficiently to best isolate the value of the commodity. Barrick has not been a top operator amongst its peers and, as a result, they abruptly parted ways with their CEO in September and replaced him with Mark Hill, the former COO, as interim CEO.

An interim CEO creates two very valuable opportunities for an activist in a company like Barrick. First and most importantly, they get to have a voice in who the new CEO will be regardless of whether they settle with the company for a board seat or just remain an outspoken shareholder. While they may not always be in the room when the discussions are had or the decision is made, we know of no CEO who would take a job at a company with an activist like Elliott engaging unless they knew that Elliott approved of the hiring.

Second, when a company has an interim CEO, it is an advantageous time to explore strategic alternatives, and a breakup of this company has always been the elephant in the room.

Barrick's North American operations have been sullied by the company's exposure to higher-risk regions and separating the two would go a long way to close the valuation gap between Barrick and Agnico Eagle .

The value proposition for a breakup is clear and even something management has discussed. In a presentation released in May, management demonstrated that applying a peer-like multiple to Barrick's North American assets could unlock as much as 49% of unrealized value. Since then, the price of gold has appreciated by over 70% but the company's stock has appreciated by more than 100%, so much of that gain has been realized but there is still some value to be realized from a breakup.

Elliott has a history of taking board seats at companies not for activist's sake, but only when they feel that the director they are putting on the board could genuinely add value for shareholders. In this case, the breakup of the company is something that is being seriously considered by the board, and Elliott, just by its existence, is likely to have at least negative approval power over the new CEO.

Moreover, Elliott does not act impetuously in its activism. They have likely had a position in Barrick for many months at this point and have already received a great return from the company's 100% appreciation in the past six months. We would not expect them to escalate their activism here unless either the board goes down a path they didn't expect and don't agree with, or it is at the company's invitation to join the board to assist with the tasks ahead.

2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"These dividend aristocrats also consistently buy back their stocks, says Wolfe","Consistency is what counts when it comes to shareholder returns, according to Wolfe Research. Investors looking for dividends should focus on those who regularly raise their payouts, analyst Chris Senyek said in a note Thursday. For instance, dividend aristocrats have increased their dividends every year for at least 25 years. Those focusing on stock buybacks should look for companies that have reduced their share count on a net basis for a minimum of 10 consecutive years, he said. ""These cohorts of stocks have generally outperformed throughout many market environments including economic slowdowns,"" Senyek said. There are 11 companies that hit both marks: They are dividend aristocrats and consistently buy back shares, he said. Here are some of the names that made the list. Walmart is well-liked by analysts, with an average rating of buy and 4% upside to the average price target, per FactSet. The big box retailer hiked its full-year sales and earnings outlook in November thanks to a double-digit rise in e-commerce and new customer growth. It also reported third-quarter results that topped expectations. Walmart has gained customers across all incomes that are seeking value, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told CNBC at the time. ""Consumers are looking to do business with those companies that are providing value, that are delivering the convenience that they've come to know and expect, and that are executing consistently well,"" he said. Walmart, which pays 0.82%, announced in February it was increasing its dividend for the 52nd consecutive year. It also said it repurchased 75.3 million shares , or $7 billion, year to date. The stock has moved 28% higher so far this year. A.O. Smith has an average analyst rating of hold and nearly 12% upside to the average price target. In October, the manufacturer of water heaters and boilers reported an earnings and revenue beat for its third quarter. However, it lowered its revenue guidance as well as the high end of its earnings guidance for the full year. ""We are cautious about the remainder of the year primarily due to continued headwinds in the China market and the impact of weakening new home construction on residential water heating in North America,"" CEO Steve Shafer said in the earnings release. ""We remain confident in our ability to manage the tariff and competitive landscapes and are pleased with the performance we achieved in our growth priorities."" A.O. Smith also recently announced it was acquiring water management technology company Leonard Valve for about $412 million. In October, the company increased the dividend it paid in November. It has hiked its payout each year for over 30 years, Shafer said. A.O. Smith repurchased 5 million shares in the first nine months of 2025 and expects to buy about 1.8 million additional shares by the end of the year. The stock has a 2.14% dividend yield and is flat year to date. Lastly, Cardinal Health has a 1.03% dividend yield and has gained nearly 68% year to date. The health-care company announced its last dividend increase in May. It also raised its baseline share repurchase plans to at least $750 million per year in July. Cardinal Health posted an earnings and revenue beat in October for its fiscal first quarter. It also hiked its earnings guidance for the full year. Analysts covering the stock give it an average rating of overweight. It has 9% upside to the average price target, per FactSet. — CNBC's Melissa Repko contributed reporting.",['Michelle Fox']

Discovery. In the deal, announced on Friday, Netflix will acquire Warner Bros.' film studio and streaming service at $27.75 per WBD share. While Brown said that he still likes the stock, the year or so it could take for this deal to settle represents a big opportunity cost in terms of other lost investments. ""I can't sit for a year and watch this become a political football and tie up capital,"" the CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management said on CNBC's "" Halftime Report "" Friday afternoon. ""It's just a portfolio management decision. I think there are going to be other opportunities that have more near-term upside while this Netflix thing works its way through the meat grinder in Washington."" Brown pointed to regulatory and antitrust scrutiny as a headwind for the acquisition, which he said is the largest M & A transaction in the post-pandemic world. ""You cannot tell me the 'Eye of Sauron' is not going to see this thing happening and say, what does this mean for us?"" he added. While Netflix ""still represents a tremendous value,"" their growth and capital expenditures could face a near-term slowdown as the company's capital gets tied up into this potential deal. Brown said that he would spend the next 12 to 18 months keeping a close eye on the stock before deciding to take further action. ""I think Netflix is a great value. I think it's a great deal. I actually love the deal for them — not only for them, but I love that they're keeping this out of the hands of somebody else — equally important in the streaming wars,"" he added.

2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"Tokenized stocks offer new opportunities for investors, but carry unique risks","Tokenized stocks are gaining ground as a way for ordinary people to access investment opportunities long reserved for high net-worth individuals and other accredited investors. But while retail traders' interest in the emerging asset class is accelerating, some experts are cautioning them to pump the breaks.

Tokenization refers to the process of creating a digital version of a real-world asset – for example, a stock, bond or real-estate deed – on a blockchain, or decentralized network. And as real-world asset tokenization booms, blockchain-based stocks have started to gain traction.

But, experts are divided on tokenized equities. The products have become popular with some as means of investing in private companies at early stages, potentially leading to outsized returns. But tokenized stocks are less regulated, and they can pose more legal and financial risks to inexperienced traders, some experts say.

""With a token, it is an instrument not issued by the company,"" said James Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University. ""It's a side bet on the future prospects of the company.""

The tokenized real-world asset market is booming. Its total value has more than quadrupled to roughly $18.2 billion over the past year, according to RWA.xyz data, with tokenized equities growing alongside the broader RWA market.

As a result, several tech companies have stepped up to meet demand for the growing asset class. Last summer, Robinhood rolled out support for more than 200 tokenized U.S. stocks like SpaceX and OpenAI to customers in the European Union. And in September, Ondo Finance launched a platform offering investors in Africa, Europe and other markets more tokenized versions of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on the Ethereum blockchain. Coinbase also unveiled this year its own plans to offer tokenized stocks as part of its ""everything-exchange"" vision.

Tokenized stocks' popularity has a lot to do with investors' eagerness to access private markets, which have historically been more profitable for traders, Angel told CNBC.

""The allure of private companies is the desire to get in early on the wealth creation when a successful business is built,"" Angel said. Typically, ""retail investors basically get the exhaust when public companies finally do go public.""

But while demand is mounting, so too are calls for investors to exercise caution.

Tokenized stocks are not the same as traditional equities, according to Angel. Their holders do not have rights in, or dividends from, the companies their tokens represent, for example.

""If I own a share in the company, I'm a shareholder with well defined legal rights,"" Angel said. ""I can vote in the annual election. I can receive any dividends … [but] if I have a token in a private company, it's not clear what legal rights I have.""

In addition, private companies that are accessible to retail investors through tokenized shares have more opaque financials than their publicly traded peers because they are not subject to the same reporting requirements. That makes it more difficult for retail investors to ascertain whether they're making a judicious investment.

Those problems add to the fact that tokenized equities are relatively new and regulatory guidelines for the asset class remain largely undefined.

""We're still in a place where the regulations and the government have not caught up with the innovation and tech,"" Azeem Khan, co-founder of privacy-focused blockchain Miden, told CNBC.

And the tokens themselves ""are for the moment rather untested,"" Angel said. ""Be like Warren Buffett, don't invest in anything you don't understand.""",['Liz Napolitano']

Meeks, head of technology research at Freedom Capital Markets and a tech analyst or portfolio manager since 1992, began research coverage of CoreWeave, a specialized cloud provider, with a buy rating and $100 price target, suggesting the stock could gain almost 17% from its Thursday close. ""Ours is not a call that the AI Bubble will not pop because of course it will, and even before then this and related stocks may need to be sold, but, in the meantime, over the next two years, we see CRWV first bouncing back to $100 (+18%) and then retesting its recent (October 10, 2025) $153 peak, as investors regain confidence in the company to deliver its backlog, and with less overall concern that the 'end is nigh' for AI infrastructure building,"" Meeks wrote in a Thursday note to clients. CoreWeave plunged 37% this quarter after cutting its prior guidance for full-year 2025 revenue a month ago, acknowledging a construction delay at one of its 41 data centers.

""Conspiracy theories have spread among investors since then, and the overall industry narrative has clearly shifted to fear the AI Bubble will soon burst and CRWV will be a victim as the largest 'neocloud,'"" Meeks said. ""Although CRWV is in investors' penalty box, we believe the stock significantly overstates the risk that it will not deliver its $56 billion multi-year revenue backlog. We believe its payments from hyperscalers, which support its capital expenditures, are secure for several years,"" Meeks continued. ""These behemoths have the financial wherewithal to continue spending, and, perhaps more importantly, each of them views early and aggressive AI infrastructure building as a key competitive advantage."" If backlogs were to fall, Meeks said that CoreWeave's backstop from Nvidia could absorb ""any extra capacity for seven years."" CoreWeave buys Nvidia's graphics processing units and rents them out to customers. At the end of the third quarter, Nvidia owned 6.56% of CoreWeave, a stake that today is worth some $2.1 billion, according to FactSet data. CoreWeave, which went public in March, was backed by Nvidia before its debut and sold more shares to Nvidia in the IPO. Looking ahead, Meeks believes that CoreWeave will be the clear leader among neoclouds . A neocloud is a specialized cloud provider offering high-performance computing, particularly Graphics-Processing-Units- as-a-Service aimed at making AI and machine-learning workloads more efficient. Nebius, a Dutch company that runs another public neocloud, has soared 250% this year on the back of robust AI demand. But CoreWeave's 2026 revenue should be nearly five times Nebius's, Meeks said. Wall Street unfairly values Nebius at 7.3 times 2026 revenue, while CoreWeave sells for just 2.8 times Meeks own sales number, said the Northwestern MBA who once managed more than $7 billion in six technology mutual funds for Merrill Lynch Investment Managers. ""CRWV does not deserve to trade at such a discount given that there is little reason to believe that the economics of their businesses will be much different in the long run,"" he said. Meeks' $100 price target falls in the middle of a wide range among analysts, between $36 at the low end and $234 at the high, according to LSEG. The Street's consensus price target of $131 suggests about 51% upside for CoreWeave.","['Pia Singh', 'In']"

2025-12-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"Trump administration will expand travel ban to more than 30 countries, Noem says","The Trump administration will be expanding its ban on travel for citizens of certain countries to more than 30, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, in the latest restriction to come since a man from Afghanistan was accused of shooting two National Guard members.

The expansion would build on a travel ban already announced in June by the Republican administration, which barred travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries and restricted access to the U.S. for people from seven others. In a social media post earlier this week, Noem had suggested more countries would be included.

Noem, who spoke late Thursday in an interview with Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham, would not provide further details, saying President Donald Trump was considering which countries would be included.

In the wake of the National Guard shooting, the administration already ratcheted up restrictions on the 19 countries included in the initial travel ban, which include Afghanistan, Somalia, Iran and Haiti, among others.

Ingraham asked Noem whether the travel ban was expanding to 32 countries and asked which countries would be added to the 19 announced earlier this year.

""I won't be specific on the number, but it's over 30. And the president is continuing to evaluate countries,"" Noem said.

""If they don't have a stable government there, if they don't have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?"" Noem said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment about when an updated travel ban might go into effect and which countries would be included in it.

Additions to the June travel ban are the latest in what has been a rapidly unfolding series of immigration actions since the shooting Thanksgiving week of two National Guard troops in Washington.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who emigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal, has been charged with first-degree murder after one of the two victims, West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, died of wounds sustained in the Nov. 26 shooting. The second victim, Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, was critically wounded. Lakanwal has pleaded not guilty.

The Trump administration has argued that more vetting is needed to make sure people entering or already in the U.S. aren't a threat. Critics say the administration is traumatizing people who've already gone through extensive vetting to get to the U.S. and say the new measures amount to collective punishment.

Over the course of a little more than a week, the administration has halted asylum decisions, paused processing of immigration-related benefits for people in the U.S. from the 19 travel ban countries and halted visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

On Thursday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it was reducing the time period that work permits are valid for certain applicants such as refugees and people with asylum so they have to reapply more often and go through vetting more frequently.",[]

When Kristin Collier applied for a credit card at age 22, she said, she was surprised to learn that her application was denied. That's when she discovered that there was over $200,000 in debt under her name that she didn't know anything about — including several student loans and credit card balances. Soon, she learned something else even more troubling: Her mother, who was grappling with a gambling addiction, had taken out nearly all of the loans without her consent. CNBC reviewed legal documents in which Collier's mother admitted to borrowing the money using her daughter's name. In Collier's new book, ""What Debt Demands: Family, Betrayal, and Precarity in a Broken System,"" she tells the story of her decadelong attempt to remove those fraudulent debts from her record, how the experience affected her relationship with her mother, and the role debt plays in so many Americans' lives. CNBC interviewed Collier about her experience. The interview below has been edited and condensed for clarity.

When I thought of my future, all I could see was more debt.

Annie Nova: How did you feel when you learned your mother had taken out all this debt in your name? Kristin Collier: I felt that my mother had chosen the casinos over me, which was not the case. It took a broader understanding of addiction and of the student loan industry's predation to recognize the harm that was also done to her. But this debt fractured our relationship and made it hard for me to trust her. At the debt's peak, I owed $2,000 a month. I had to work multiple jobs to make these payments, and when I thought of my future, all I could see was more debt.

AN: I'm curious about what harm you believe was done to your mother. KC: She should not have been able to take out those loans. Had the private student loan industry acted responsibly, they would have noticed something was off with my credit history. The amount of money borrowed far exceeded what I ever would need to attend a public university in state. Someone should have rejected the fraudulent loan application, and through that rejection, spared my mother and me. AN: What connections do you see between gambling and debt? KC: The gambling industry is incredibly predatory. Most of a casino's revenue is generated from slot machines, and much of the slot machine revenue is generated from a small subset of gamblers. Casinos design an entire ecosystem around funneling people toward these machines and keeping them on these machines past their pain points. They use every available tool to extract money, and this experience creates debt and sometimes it also creates addicts.

She should not have been able to take out those loans.

AN: Do you know how your mother spent the money she borrowed? KC: I'm not sure exactly how the loan money was used. Most of it, I imagine, went to the casinos to win back what had already been lost. It's possible that some of it was used to keep the family afloat — helping to pay for the mortgage, for example — because the rest of [the family's] money had already been gambled away. AN: Did you know your mother had a gambling addiction? KC: My mother's addiction seemed to have started around the time I began college, which means that I was mostly away from home during the years it was the worst. While I sensed that we had less money than we had when I was younger, I didn't understand that addiction was at the heart of it. AN: Why was the debt so hard to get taken off your record? KC: Because I was unwilling to use the criminal legal system. As a result, it was a huge challenge to get the loan companies to work with me, or even, at times, to talk to me.

Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Courtesy: Blanca Aulet | Hachette Book Group USA

AN: How did you finally get it scrubbed? KC: After 10 years of refuting this debt, I used the bankruptcy process to force a conversation, and my mother, the lenders and I signed paperwork that removed the debt from my name. In some ways, I was lucky, because bankruptcy is not a pathway to relief for most student borrowers. AN: How did the debt impact your health? KC: In my early 20s, living in New York City, and being harassed by debt collectors, I was sick all the time. I had ulcers and UTIs and stomach infections. I think the stress of living with unpayable debt was showing up in all these illnesses.

Debt payment is always a cruel calculation.

AN: How does debt become a family problem? KC: A family with fewer resources will very likely translate to more debt for their student, and maybe for the parents, too, if they take out a Parent Plus Loan. So, debt is first determined by family and then often shared by the family. This is the case because we do not have universal free higher education, the only funding model that would make education a state ""problem"" rather than a family one. In my case, this debt harmed all of us. With interest rates over 10%, we were throwing our very hard-earned paychecks toward a growing debt burden. There was very little extra income for leisure or for other kinds of familial care, to save for retirement or for housing, or for when my father became sick, all of his cancer treatment. Debt payment is always a cruel calculation; what goes toward loans does not go elsewhere.",['Annie Nova']
2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"I've been a pediatrician for 10 years—here are 9 'hard truths' parents need to hear: It will 'help you raise happier, healthier kids'","Parenting is full of love and joy, but it also comes with a few hard truths we'd rather not face.

In my 10 years as a pediatrician, I've seen the same patterns again and again: Parents who want the best for their kids but sometimes miss what actually helps them thrive.

Some of these truths might sting a little, but they're not meant to shame. They're meant to help us reflect and hopefully, raise happier, healthier kids.

1. If you're not modeling an action, behavior, or value, don't expect them to do the same.

Kids copy what they see more than what they're told. How you speak, handle stress, and make things right matters.

If you want them to learn kindness and respect, show it in action. I try to model this in the small, everyday moments — how I speak to employees at the grocery store, how I apologize if I lose my patience, how I talk about people when they're not around. Kids catch that energy, fast.

2. If you always rescue them from boredom, they'll never learn to be comfortable being idle.

Boredom is the spark for creativity. When every moment is filled with entertainment, kids lose the chance to explore their own ideas. Give them the space to figure it out.

3. If you feel like your child is overscheduled, they are. Scale things back.

When afternoons turn into a relay race between soccer, piano, and playdates, it's a fast track to burnout … for everyone. Downtime gives their body and brain room to breathe. Protect it.

4. Set the bedtime. Keep the routine. Sleep is a necessity.

Sleep powers growth, learning, and emotional balance. Toddlers usually need about 11 to 14 hours, preschoolers 10 to 13, school-age kids 9 to 12, and teens 8 to 10. But these are just ranges. What matters most is how your child functions: If they wake up rested, don't nod off at odd times, and aren't showing signs of poor sleep like irritability or trouble focusing, they're likely getting enough.

5. Seriously, stop the excessive snacking. That's why they're not eating meals.

When kids snack all day, they never build an appetite. If they don't love their meal, they'll simply hold out until snack time. Planning snacks so they're predictable gives kids structure and time to feel hungry again, which encourages them to show up for meals.

6. You don't need fancy 'immune-boosting' supplements.

The real immune boosters? Sleep, nutritious meals, hydration, physical activity, and washing hands. There's no powder or gummy that can compete.

7. Stop asking for antibiotics just because a cough lingers.

Most coughs after a viral infection last for weeks. Extra antibiotics don't speed healing. They just increase resistance and side effects.

Often, time and comfort care are key. I usually recommend keeping the air moist with a cool-mist humidifier, offering warm fluids like honey water (if over age 1), using saline and suction for congestion, and letting them rest.

Of course, you should always check in with a pediatrician, especially if things seem to be worsening.

8. Don't use screens or food to calm every meltdown.

It's tempting to reach for quick fixes, but distraction isn't regulation. Kids need opportunities to practice coping skills like naming emotions, breathing, learning that these feelings will pass.

9. If your child goes to an Ivy League college but can't handle disappointment, you've missed the point.

Academic success means little if a child crumbles under stress. Resilience, the skill of falling, learning, and trying again, is what truly prepares them for life.

Parenting asks us to grow, too. These truths can sting, but awareness builds strong families. And again, it's always important to keep a close relationship with your pediatrician and consult them before making any major changes to your child's health routines.

2025-12-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Why your crypto wealth may never make it to the next generation,"Roughly 1 in 7 people are leaving unclaimed property on the table, according to the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators. While the recent heavy selling in bitcoin and ether is rightly getting all the short-term attention, this estate planning issue is a longer-term one that's likely to be exacerbated as crypto adoption and ownership increase.

Many people neglect to account for cryptocurrency in their estate plans, or they don't let their heirs know how to access their crypto holdings. With surveys in recent years from Gallup and Pew Research estimating that 14% to 17% of U.S. adults have owned cryptocurrency, losing access to those funds is a growing concern.

""Leaving property or mutual funds behind in a will is pretty cut and dried, but with more and more assets placed in cryptocurrency, a large share of inherited assets are in danger of forfeiture,"" said Azriel Baer, partner in the estate planning and administration group at law firm Farrell Fritz.

This issue could be mitigated, in part, by crypto ETFs, which are gaining popularity with investors since the first batch of spot bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC in 2024, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), followed a few months later by ethereum spot price ETFs, such as the Fidelity Ethereum Fund ETF (FETH). These ETFs allow investors access to the crypto asset class without actually owning crypto outright, helping reduce the chances of actual crypto getting lost.

Nevertheless, estate planning mistakes among crypto owners are common and can be avoided. Here are some of the biggest issues cryptocurrency owners need to tackle sooner rather than later.

Wills, if they exist, often don't include digital assets language

Only 24% of Americans have a will that describes how they want their money and estate managed after their death, according to a survey from Caring.com. Even people who have wills in place have not updated them for many years, with nearly one in four Americans saying they haven't touched their wills since their original was drafted, according to the survey.

This can be problematic for many reasons. An old will may no longer reflect people's current wishes. In a crypto-specific context, anyone who hasn't updated their estate plan in the past several years may not have language to provide legal authority for the trustee or executor to gain access to digital assets.

""It's very common for people not to update their estate planning documents for 10, 20 years or sometimes longer. If that's the case, you're behind,"" said Patrick D. Owens, shareholder at Buchalter and a member of the law firm's tax, benefits and estate planning practice group.

Absent language about digital assets, your heirs might have to go to court to get the authority for the executor or administrator of the estate to gain access to the crypto assets. Most likely they'll get access, ""but it's a hassle,"" Owens said. ""Obviously, it means time and money going into court.""

Even with a will, crypto assets can get stuck in court

A standard will is appropriate for many people, but many attorneys recommend clients also utilize a revocable living trust as part of their estate plan. Drafting a will is less expensive, but a revocable living trust offers more privacy and can help limit the time and expense of the probate process after death.

Baer advises clients to transfer their crypto to a revocable living trust so the trustee has immediate access upon the owner's death. It could be six to eight months, or more, before a will is settled in probate and in the meantime, heirs wouldn't have access to the assets. If the price of the crypto was going down rapidly, for example, they would have to wait to sell it if the estate was caught up in probate. Putting crypto assets into a revocable trust to avoid probate can prevent a lot of headaches, he said.

Generally, a revocable trust is paired with a pour-over will so that assets not included in the trust at the time of a person's death are transferred to the trust and distributed accordingly.

Not sharing basic crypto information can cost millions

You don't have to tell heirs you're worth a fortune in bitcoin before you pass away, but you should make sure they know how to access your crypto after you're gone.

Baer worked on an estate where tens of millions of dollars in crypto were lost to the heirs because they didn't know the decedent's private keys, which function as digital passwords to grant access to cryptocurrency funds and prove ownership of blockchain assets.

Someone should know how to access the assets, whether through written instructions in a safe box, a safe at home, or directions kept with a lawyer or with one of the various crypto inheritance services that help ensure crypto assets are passed on to your family members, Baer said. Don't put these private keys or other sensitive information in a will, because wills become public through the probate process, he added.

Many designated fiduciaries can't handle crypto

The person you chose to handle your other assets may not be the right person to deal with the crypto portion of your estate.

Not everyone understands crypto, the associated volatility or how to transact with digital currency, meaning lots of money can inadvertently be lost. The recent volatility in the price of bitcoin is a reminder that if you name someone who needs weeks to get up to speed on how to transact with bitcoin, the financial losses could be meaningful, Baer said. ""Uncle Bob may be a great person, but he may have more challenges transacting with an asset class he's totally not familiar with,"" he added.

Sometimes, even institutional trustees might not be able to take on the responsibility for crypto. Owens had a client pass away with half a million dollars in bitcoin and ether. The institutional trustee who oversaw the client's account refused to take on the responsibility for the crypto and a special trustee was named. Luckily, the client had a nephew who took on the role, but finding a suitable replacement can often be costly from a time and money perspective, Owens said.

Failure to plan for crypto estate taxes

With the massive explosion in the values around cryptocurrency, many people have large crypto holdings, which could be subject to significant taxes, whether that's income taxes or estate taxes, and failure to plan could be detrimental to their families, said Jonathan Forster, shareholder at law firm Weinstock Manion.

There could, for example, be estate taxes due, depending on the size of the estate. The federal estate tax exemption for 2025 is $13.99 million per individual. Some states also have a state-level estate tax.

Knowing the impact crypto ownership might have on your estate is an important consideration while you are alive. Forster has clients whose crypto holdings are worth more than $50 million. They wanted an efficient way to make gifts for the benefit of their children to get some money out of their estate. They created a limited liability corporation, transferred the crypto into the LLC and gifted an interest in the LLC to an irrevocable trust for the benefit of minor children with an independent trustee, Forster said.

Many crypto investors fail to keep track of cost basis, which can be problematic for many reasons, including if you're considering gifting digital assets during your lifetime. If you want to gift the assets while you're alive, you need to have the basis so the recipient can properly account for the crypto if it's eventually sold, Baer said. ""It can be onerous to keep track of basis, but it's important,"" he said.",['Cheryl Winokur Munk']

The Transportation Department under the Biden administration in late 2023 fined the Dallas-based airline $140 million, though the agency then credited the airline with all but $35 million of that amount because of its compensation to customers.

In an order filed Friday, the Transportation Department cited Southwest's more than $1 billion investments in its technology and operation since the holiday meltdown as reason for the additional credit. Southwest was due to make the last payment next month.

""Southwest Airlines is grateful to [Transportation] Secretary [Sean] Duffy and the DOT Team for recognizing Southwest's significant investments in modernizing our operations,"" Southwest said Saturday.

Ultragenyx is a $3.5-billion biopharmaceutical company based outside San Francisco that focuses on developing treatments for rare and ultrarare diseases. The company went public on Nasdaq in 2014. Shares of Ultragenyx are down 23% over the past 12 months, but JPMorgan's price target of $120 implies potential upside of more than 225% from Thursday's close of $36.54.

JPMorgan believes that Wall Street may be underappreciating the drug's full potential. ""Our Overweight rating on RARE shares is based on our positive outlook on setrusumab, underappreciated pipeline levers, and continued commercial momentum,"" Rama said. ""At current levels, we see minimal value being ascribed to setrusumab (or the broader pipeline).

2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Netflix shares get hit on Warner Bros. tie-up. What the deal means for the stock,"Shares of Netflix were under pressure as investors digested the streaming giant's blockbuster agreement to acquire pieces of Warner Bros. Discovery , a move some say could weigh on the stock for some time despite long-term strategic upside. Netflix shares fell 2.9% Friday after it announced a deal to buy WBD's film studio and streaming service, HBO Max, bringing an end to a dramatic bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the legacy assets. Rich Greenfield, LightShed Partners co-founder, believes the economics of the transaction are likely to weigh on Netflix before they help in the long term. ""Look, the math is going to hurt Netflix for a while. There's no doubt,"" Greenfield said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""This is expensive. They think this is accretive in year two. Obviously, we have to understand how they get there, but maybe it's just that there's so much stuff that they can turbocharge."" ""This is a huge price, and I don't see how Paramount can top this bid. This seems like a number that is just too big,"" he added. The transaction is comprised of cash and stock and is valued at $27.75 per WBD share. The acquisition is expected to close in 12 to 18 months. Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion reverse breakup fee if the deal is not approved. Still, Greenfield noted that the long-term opportunity could be substantial if Netflix can unlock and scale the value of Warner's vast intellectual property. ""They are going to make a tremendous amount of content,"" he said. ""The amount of content that's going to be made out of Warner Brothers library is gonna go up dramatically. There's so much stuff collecting dust right now."" The historic deal brings together the streaming giant Netflix, which has upended the media industry in recent years, and the storied Warner Bros. film studio, known for its library including ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the Harry Potter franchise and the DC comics universe. It will also include the content of HBO Max, including ""The Sopranos"" and ""Game of Thrones."" Netflix shares came off their lows briefly after CNBC reported the Trump administration views the proposed $72 billion deal with ""heavy skepticism."" Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",['Yun Li']
2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Wall Street loves Meta’s reported metaverse cuts. Most analysts see 20%-plus gain for stock,"Across Wall Street, analysts adopted a jovial response after Bloomberg News reported that Meta plans to make cuts to its metaverse unit. Meta's stock climbed 5% on Thursday following Bloomberg's report, which said that executives are considering budget cuts as high as 30% for the unit, citing people familiar with the talks. The cuts would likely hit Meta's virtual reality group and would likely include layoffs, Bloomberg wrote. Analysts celebrated the news, saying that it suggested the company's financial discipline remains in play and that Meta has ensured its continued focus on efficiency and growth. ""The news today, in our view, suggests Meta can deliver continued product-led growth as it reallocates resources to its greatest opportunities,"" wrote Citi analyst Ronald Josey, who reiterated Meta as his top stock pick. Here's what analysts at some of Wall Street's biggest shops had to say on the report. JPMorgan: overweight, $800 JPMorgan's target implies about 21% upside from Meta's Thursday close. ""We are encouraged that Meta is hearing the message from the Street on expense discipline, though we still believe it is important to emphasize guardrails around GAAP EPS growth, operating income growth, and positive FCF amidst the heavy capex buildout."" Wells Fargo: overweight, $802 Wells Fargo's forecast corresponds to upside of around 21%. ""See press reports of potential 30% budget cuts at Reality Labs as clear sign that Meta leadership is taking an active approach to re-orient the cost structure to AI-related initiatives. Estimate potential savings of roughly $2 in EPS annualized."" Bank of America: buy, $810 Bank of America's forecast calls for 22% upside going forward. ""Our Take: While we assume costs will still grow materially in 2026, and at a faster rate than in 2025, we think it is constructive to think about the magnitude of flexibility that Meta may have with 2026 cost allocations. In other words, Meta likely has cost contingencies next year to help maintain EPS growth even if there are macro pressures on revenues."" Citi: buy, $850 Analyst Ronald Josey's forecast is 28% above Meta's Thursday closing price. ""While a 10% annual expense reduction has been the norm at Meta since 2022, the potential significant cut from Metaverse investments clearly frees up resources for Super Intelligence Labs as newer AI products come to market in '26. Since 3Q25 earnings, the debate has focused on the mix of investment across Meta's core R & R improvements vs. Super Intelligence relative to revenue growth and the news today, in our view, suggests Meta can deliver continued product-led growth as it reallocates resources to its greatest opportunities."" Rosenblatt: buy, $1,117 The firm's price target was approximately 69% higher than where Meta closed on Thursday. The news if true ""could be meaningfully helpful for the equity … Our belief is that Reality spending, which drives we estimate $17.6B of operating losses in 2025E, is largely operating expense, not capex … So a pare back to focus on more imminent priorities could be very helpful for sentiment, and help relate the stock to a multiple more appropriate for its cash flow growth — i.e. closer to our $1,117 price target, which we believe is Street high, and which assumes an EV of 20x 2026E EBITDA."" NewStreet Research: no rating, no price target ""The reported cuts are not only highly rational but help relieve growing investor anxiety ahead of the initial 2026 total expense guidance range on the late January, 4Q25 earnings call … Today's report is reassuring investors that META is doubling down on efforts to rationalize costs and partially offset near-certain margin contraction in 2026, driven by accelerating depreciation growth and new employee compensation for Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL) hires.""",['Lisa Kailai Han']
2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"Morgan Stanley upgrades rare earth stock, says the U.S. has chosen it as solution to China's dominance","MP Materials is one stock that could benefit as the Trump administration tries to bring the production of rare earths closer to home, according to Morgan Stanley. The bank upgraded the rare-earth miner to an overweight rating from in-line. Analyst Carlos De Alba also raised his price target to $71 from $68.50. Shares of MP Materials have surged 296% this year. De Alba's updated forecast equates to further gains of 15% ahead. MP YTD mountain MP YTD chart As a catalyst, De Alba pointed to MP's development of a ""fully domestic rare earth mine-to-magnet supply chain in the U.S.,"" putting it in the prime position to benefit as the U.S. tries to develop ex-China supply chains. While Beijing has paused its rare earth restrictions for a year, De Alba said that this does not solve critical mineral or dependency issues from the U.S.'s part, or resolve the length and cumbersome process to obtain export licenses. ""Geopolitical tensions, although temporarily subdued, continue to raise doubts about the supply of these critical components and elevate MP's strategic value, as evidenced by the historic deal with the Department of Defense this summer and more recently with the JV between the DoD, MP and Ma'aden,"" the analyst wrote. He highlighted MP's recent deal with the U.S. Department of Defense and Saudi Arabian mining company Maaden as a recent tailwind. Under this agreement, the Defense Department will finance the U.S. portion of the development of a rare earth refinery in Saudi Arabia. Another benefit is that this deal provides MP with ""significant flexibility in the upstream at zero capital costs."" To De Alba, this deal is proof of the ""U.S. having effectively chosen MP Materials as the U.S. solution."" The deal also underscores MP's vertical integration strategy to go from mine to magnet production, making it the only global fully integrated supplier of permanent magnets, the analyst added.",['Lisa Kailai Han']
2025-12-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"Some AI stocks that trade at a reasonable price, according to Citigroup","Investors should turn to less explored pockets of the market to find stocks that are a play on the artificial intelligence boom but also offer growth at a reasonable price (GARP), Citigroup analysts say. Discernment is growing in the tech sector amid concern of an AI investment bubble, recently driving a wedge between winners and losers. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has lagged behind the S & P 500 over the past month, with November proving a particularly choppy month for tech stocks. ""It's not really about hedging as much as it is actually stock selecting within AI,"" Citigroup U.S. equity strategy director Drew Pettit said Thursday on CNBC's ""The Exchange."" ""There's winners and losers. You see it in the 'Mag Seven' and you see it more broadly in AI. So, for us, focus on the companies that are getting the best cash returns for the growth capex they're spending, and you want to be underweight the names that might not be able to self-fund."" Citi believes that although current valuations do not yet reflect an AI bubble, rapid stock price appreciation and soaring valuations are putting more pressure on companies. To better manage the risk of something going wrong, Citigroup earlier this fall published a basket of stocks for clients that includes companies across an array of industries that still presents a path into AI. The recommendations range from Eaton Corp. to Meta Platforms, and from Nvidia to Pinterest . Citi touted the ""AI at a Reasonable Price"" group as diversified, with future consensus earnings estimates matching or exceeding market expectations. ""There are some red flags emerging around the degree to which future growth is being pulled forward into today's prices, but markets are still doing a reasonable job reflecting premium growth expectations in valuations,"" Pettit wrote in that recent 21-page report to clients. ""However, we are aware that it is ultimately earnings disappointments that drive bubble[s to] burst. If that is the case, as prices and valuations rise, we want to focus more on GARP within AI for building core thematic positioning."" Design software maker Adobe is a standout earnings play from Citigroup's list, with consensus earnings per share estimates exceeding the market-implied growth estimate. Adobe has lost 26% year to date, far underperforming the Nasdaq and several tech peers. In 2024, Adobe also fell 25%, yet its latest third-quarter results topped analysts forecasts and it gave strong forward guidance. Pettit's list also includes several of the largest semiconductor makers, such as Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices and Micron Technology , with Citigroup saying they also still trade at reasonable valuations. Citi, which has a buy rating on Nvidia, is bullish on the Synopsis partnership with Nvidia. Nvidia on Monday said it bought $2 billion of Synopsys' common stock at $414.79 per share in a multi-year alliance to accelerate computing and AI engineering solutions . Despite its three-year-long bull market and string of recent acquisitions, investors are reassured by Nvidia's $60.6 billion cash fortress at the end of October . Other stocks that are a reasonably valued path into AI infrastructure include Eaton , which also screens for high earnings potential, according to Citi. Other analysts agree that the power management company, once a hot stock play for AI data centers, is now undervalued. Eaton shares are up just 2% this year, but analysts polled by LSEG have a target price that suggests 19% potential upside over the coming year.","['Pia Singh', 'In']"
2025-12-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Where to lock in 4% yields on CDs ahead of likely Fed rate cut,"Investors looking to lock in income ahead of another likely rate cut from the Federal Reserve can still find solid yields in certificates of deposit. Some are even yielding 4%. The market is pricing in 87% odds that the central bank will reduce rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its meeting next week, according to the CME FedWatch tool . Rates on cash instruments like money market funds and high-yield savings accounts are expected to follow suit. The current annualized seven-day yield on the Crane 100 list of the largest taxable money market funds is 3.79%. The median annual percentage rate on high-yield savings accounts is 3.65%, BTIG found. Last week, American Express cut its online savings rate by 0.10 percentage point to 3.40%, BTIG analyst Vincent Caintic said in a note Sunday. ""It appears to us that, slowly but steadily each week, each bank will eventually cut once in 4Q25,"" Caintic wrote. ""Perhaps increasing probabilities of a December Fed Funds Rate cut … is aiding online bank confidence in cutting deposit rates."" To get ahead of a dip in cash rates, investors can lock in yield with CDs. The median one-year CD rate today is 3.8%, Caintic said. No banks in his coverage reduced their annual percentage yield (APY) last week, but Capital One decreased its yield this week to 3.90% from 4.05%. Still, investors should make sure they don't need the cash while it is locked up in a CD, otherwise they face penalties if they make an early withdrawal. Another option is building a CD ladder. In other words, buy CDs of varying maturities that provide income at different times. Chelsea Ransom-Cooper, co-founder and chief financial planning officer at Zenith Wealth Partners in Philadelphia, suggests investors build a ladder ranging 3 months to 14 months. ""It gives them a bit of a hedge in case they need the cash sooner rather than later, so they're not waiting for their money at one specific date, but they have a few different options on when they could pull the cash out,"" Ransom-Cooper, a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council , recently told CNBC . While CD rates are down from their highs, they are still attractive from the days of zero interest rates. Back in June 2021, for example, the average one-year APY was just 0.17%, according to Bankrate .",['Michelle Fox']

Why Stephanie Link is adding to her position,"Meta 's Thursday rally on the back of a layoff report is warranted and should be the start of more upside to come, according to Stephanie Link , chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors. The Facebook parent's stock jumped nearly 4% in the session after Bloomberg reported , citing people familiar, that CEO Mark Zuckerberg was planning to cut as much as 30% of its metaverse division's budget. Bloomberg reported that the move would include job losses, which would likely impact the virtual reality unit. ""This is what Zuckerberg does,"" Link said Thursday on CNBC's ""Halftime Report."" META 1D mountain Meta Platforms, 1-day Zuckerberg's formula begins with a quarterly earnings report, in which the company says it will increase capital expenditures with more spending to come in the following year, Link said. The stock falls as a result. Then, she said, Zuckerberg announces cost cuts in part of the business, resulting in a rebound. According to Link, Reality Labs would have burned through $19 billion this year and $24 billion next year. Thursday's announcement shows Zuckerberg is getting ""more disciplined"" on spending amid a shift in focus toward artificial intelligence, she added. ""He is going from hardware to AI and data center,"" Link said. ""It's very, very clear."" Zuckerberg needs to show he can continue to increase revenue while also keeping margins steady or growing, Link said. Despite Thursday's pop, she pointed out that the stock is still down around 20% from highs. Meta stock has added more than 13% in 2025, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite has jumped more than 21%. ""I've been adding and I will continue to buy,"" Link said. ""It should be up way more than this in my opinion."" Wall Street agrees with Link. The average analyst polled by LSEG has a buy rating and upside of more than 25%. Joseph Terranova, senior managing director at Virtus Investment Partners, added that the departure of Apple 's user interface design head, Alan Dye, to Meta as another positive sign. ""Zuckerberg is incredibly competitive. I think he's showing that today,"" Terranova said. ""In 2021, when he introduced Reality Labs, it probably didn't go as planned. And I think this is an admission of that.""",['Alex Harring']
2025-12-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"An under-the-radar medical device stock with 20% upside, according to the charts","Every December one of my annual exercises is to look at which sectors have underperformed and are likely to turn things around. This year the popular answer has been health care and there's reason to believe that the industry's recent rally may have legs. When looking at the sector we tend to focus on the big drug makers and giant pharma stocks. We've seen the SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF (XLV) bouncing and the biotech sector making new 52-week highs. However, there's a forgotten aspect within the space that's starting to raise eyebrows among technicians - that's medical devices (using the iShares US Medical Devices ETF (IHI) ). Last week I joined Worldwide Exchange with Frank Holland and touched on the turnaround happening within the sector and shared my pick of Idexx Labs (IDXX) . IDXX is the fourth largest holding within the IHI ETF (fun fact – it's also the largest company in the state of Maine) and just broke out to all-time highs. The stock looks great on multiple time frames. In fact, the whole sector looks great on multiple time frames as my friend and fellow CMT, Katie Stockton wrote about on Pro this Monday . I agree wholeheartedly. When making my stock choice for Worldwide Exchange there was another idea within the sector I wanted to share, but I could only pick one for the TV segment. The other stock I'm looking at is Steris (STE) – the global leader in sterilization and infection prevention solutions. Looking at the stock over multiple time frames gives us a phenomenal risk/reward set-up. First, the longer term as seen in this 5-year weekly chart. Not surprisingly shares peaked at the end of the Covid pandemic. They gave back all those gains and have slowly been working their way higher ever since. Now, there's a clear breakout. Its RSI momentum indicator continues to trend higher and is not in danger of being overbought – meaning there's room to run and momentum is its tailwind. The trade The long-term investor can easily set parameters of risk/reward using the breakout above $250. On several occasions this level has acted as resistance and so often following a break above that threshold former resistance acts as support. Use levels just under $250 to add a preventive stop if it fails to push higher. To the upside look for shares to push to the $300 level over the next two quarters, which equates to roughly a 20%-25% gain. Over the short term it may take a little time to push further as overhead resistance at $267.50 is clear. The $250 level has been tested once and held, we believe it will hold again if tested. Again, over both time frames, a clear risk/reward narrative has been formed. Given the relative strength of Steris, which is up 26% year-to-date compared to the medical device sector which has gains of 8.7%, the leadership is clear, and we believe it will continue to lead as rotation into the medical device sector continues.

Here are his takeover candidates,"Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo believes that investors may be missing out on the next deregulation-led M & A boom. In a Wednesday note to clients, Mayo made the case that bank mergers and acquisitions will accelerate amid the ""best regulatory inflection in three decades."" ""Multi-year deregulation story is still underappreciated. We continue to believe that banks are in a generational period of deregulation,"" Mayo wrote. ""Clarity on stress tests, finalization of Basel 3 endgame and a lighter touch toward deals and regulatory interpretation are all in early stages that can continue through 2028."" Upcoming regulatory tailwinds could include fast approvals and less scrutiny for large deals. Banks also have a higher ability to extract cost synergies, such as through branch closures, and less restriction would result in more buyers eligible for the large financial institution, or LFI, designation. The analyst added that banks generally tend to outperform during similar periods of deregulation, as they did in the late 1990s. In the same note, he also shared a few stocks that are the most likely takeover candidates. To compile it, Mayo screened the top 450 banks and ranked them based on a 10-point scale that accessed attributes like fair value, profitability, efficiency, loan-to-deposit ratio and valuation as well as management's age and comments they have made. The screen also looked to see if an activist was involved and the geographic location of the business.

2025-12-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Wisdom of crowds: Josh Brown says the market is telling you this stock is special,"(This is The Best Stocks in the Market , brought to you by Josh Brown and Sean Russo of Ritholtz Wealth Management.) Here's a quick, informal test I use when I'm talking to a professional asset manager about their investing philosophy. I ask them why does a stock go up a lot? They joke back ""more buyers than sellers"" and we both giggle. Then I say no, seriously, is the stock market mostly right or mostly wrong? Most professionals will agree, at least privately, that rallying stocks attract their attention (and their interest and their research) because there is a wisdom in the uncoordinated actions of the masses. Most professionals are reasonable and open-minded in the presence of a bull market, even when they themselves have missed the early stages of it. They may not always agree with the crowd, but they know better than to summarily dismiss it. When millions of people decide to buy a stock or a sector or an asset class all at once without having a group conversation amongst each other, it's notable. First the story — the Why — becomes widespread and then price action does the rest. And sometimes, the price action is the story. Nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd. This is not the same as saying the market is always right or that every stock that goes higher deserves to. The market is right, until it isn't, and then perhaps the crowd learns a new story. But if I'm talking to someone who wakes up looking for things to be contrarian about, I probably wouldn't invest with that person. If I'm talking to someone whose overarching investing philosophy is that everyone else is dumb and he or she (let's be honest, this is always a he) is going to outsmart the entire world on a daily basis, I know I'm talking to a serial underperformer. You can log onto your favorite social media app and find these people. They're posting all day. They're not busy — they have mostly been drummed out of the hedge fund business over the years and are now selling their own brand of sophisticated skepticism via Substack. Every post is something sarcastic about what other investors are doing and saying. The smugness is thicker than split pea. The crowd is always wrong and they are always right. If only everyone else would come to their senses, these guys would be managing billions of dollars and all would be right with the world. But alas… As a professional investor, I believe the crowd often knows things early, before they can be put into words in the media. And then once the media learns the story well enough to repeat it in articles and TV segments, it's gotten late. I don't believe that everyone is dumb and that my job is to wake up and outsmart a hundred million other investors. I believe in identifying trends — higher and lower — and then using those trends to better understand the world. If that makes sense to you, then you're one of us. Today we're going to introduce you to a new company you've probably never heard of before. It's been on our Best Stocks in the Market list for awhile but we haven't gotten around to writing it up until now. When we wrote up Amphenol (APH) this summer, we talked about it as a stealth beneficiary of the AI data center capex explosion, although that was only part of the story. The stock turned out to have been a home run. It's got a competitor called AMETEK (AME) which has been in business since its founding 95 years ago in 1930 when it was known as American Machine and Metals, Inc. AME came public in 1984 and has quietly become one of the most important players in some of today's fastest growing industries, from aerospace and defense to electrical power generation. The crowd has recognized AME's potential which has led to a modest rally toward record highs and a valuation re-rating higher. Is the crowd stupid? I don't think so. Sean's going to share some insight into the company's recent fundamental strength and then I will talk about the technical setup… Best Stock Spotlight: AMETEK, Inc. (AME) On the list since: 10/30/2025. Sean — Before diving into the fundamentals of AME, Amphenol, which has been one of our best picks this year, is up 48% since we mentioned it. Oftentimes, investors are looking for value. That's what everyone learned in college. Buffett has rightly been preaching it for 50 years. It's easy to conceptualize, too. Pay $2 for a pen worth $3, simple enough. Momentum is less intuitive. Buying the stocks that already look amazing flies in the face of the value investor. However, following that strategy would have allowed you to outperform the mighty Nasdaq 100 by 34% the past 5 years: This Amphenol price chart starts at the beginning of 2022 and goes through 6/20/2025, the day we wrote up APH: 99% of people's first reaction is that they missed it. Well, we saw the price add about 45 points to what was a $90 stock. Here it is YTD: We happened to get this call right, though not every stock we write about will work. Still, prices usually trend higher for a reason, and we are believers in the wisdom of crowds as long as the fundamentals support it. The same idea can apply to AME. This company reported incredible earnings on 10/30. They reported record numbers in sales, orders, operating profit, and EPS. Sales were up 11%, net income was up 9.2%, and full year EPS targets were raised to $7.32-$7.37, up 7-8% year-over-year. AME operates in a few key markets, similar to APH. Within all 4 markets (aerospace and defense, automation and engineered solutions, power and industrial, and medical) the firm delivered top line growth in every one. Excluding acquisitions, AME saw 90bps in margin expansion this prior quarter. YTD, the company has expanded operating margins by 70bps, hitting 27.5% through the third quarter. AME expects about 8% EPS growth to finish this year and about 8.5% next year. AME's valuation has been consistent historically. Its 10yr median valuation is 27x vs 31x today, albeit with lower margins in previous years relative to the current business. The chart above shows AME's EBIT margin since inception, along with its trailing P/E ratio. Both have stair-stepped higher along with its price. The technicals are solid, and the fundamentals are proving why. Risk management Josh — AMETEK doesn't have any earnings report coming til early February and no major investor events on the calendar before then. So in the absence of any major news that we're aware of, all we have in front of us is the trend itself. The trend is higher. AME broke above $200 for a brief moment on Halloween and it's been in a shallow consolidation ever since. In the chart below, you can see the buyers popping up at the 50-day: With the stock just 5% above that moving average, this level is too close to set a stop. I'd be using $182, which is both the bottom of the last gap higher as well as the 200-day moving average. AME has held its 200-day since July. A convincing rip below and it's time to move to the sideline to reassess. Above that level I think you can stay long.

2025-12-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Mike Khouw found a defense technology stock with strong momentum not named Palantir,"Traveling back from a conference in Florida this week, the TSA line promoted a company involved in ""zero-trust"" cybersecurity. Once on the plane, I was seated near a government official preparing a presentation on irregular warfare and failures in U.S.-Iran policy. It got me thinking: what innovative technology companies are serving the U.S. government that actually also meet my typical battery of equity screening tests of growth, momentum, preferably combined with valuations a little lower than the jet I was flying in? The S & P 500 has a 5-year revenue compound annual growth rate of about 6% and an EPS CAGR of 8%, so I set both as a floor. It's hard to claim a stock has ""momentum"" if it is trading below the 50-day moving average, or the 200-day, for that matter, so stocks failing that test were similarly excluded. Solid growth rates are nothing if they are either slowing or not expected to continue. So companies whose revenue growth had slowed in the past twelve months, whose subsequent FY revenue growth was less than 6%, or those that had seen recent negative revisions to revenue estimates were similarly dismissed from consideration. Only 20 companies in the Russell 1000 met this admittedly rigorous test, and only one of those 20 is a technology company that supports national security in intelligence and defense, serving both federal and civilian sectors: CACI International Inc. CACI serves the U.S. defense and intelligence agencies, providing software, IT modernization, and specialized technology solutions deeply embedded in customers' operations, including national security priorities such as electronic warfare, signals intelligence, space-based ISR, zero-trust cyber, and 5G/next-gen communications. Perhaps you're wondering what ""zero-trust cyber"" is, which I wanted to delve into a bit more deeply after seeing the airport advertisements. Zero-trust cyber (or zero trust security / zero trust architecture) is a cybersecurity model built around one blunt idea: ""Never trust, always verify."" Instead of assuming things inside your network are safe, and things outside are dangerous, zero trust assumes everything could be compromised – users, devices, apps, and networks – and forces them to prove they're trustworthy every time they ask for access. This differs from the old security model we're typically accustomed to, which takes a ""castle and moat"" approach that uses big perimeter defenses such as firewalls, VPNs. Still, once you're inside the network, you're mostly trusted. In this structure, attackers who gain access can often move laterally and cause significant damage. In a zero-trust environment, every user and device must be authenticated and authorized for each resource, every time, and it assumes the network might already be compromised. This is but one of the seven markets the company identified in its most recent investor presentation in October: FY2026 revenue guidance of $9.2 - $9.4 billion represents growth of more than 8%, the company's own 3-year financial targets are for high-single digit revenue growth and more than 15% free cash flow growth and order backlog of $34 billion and $13 billion in bids are expected to be submitted within the next two quarters, 75% of which is for new business. (source: CACI Investor Presentation, October 2025). The trade Intermediate support is ~ $570 per share, a 3.67% discount to the current stock price - one can sell the January 570 puts at $15.10 - which offer a standstill yield of more than 2.6% over 44 days, or an annualized rate of more than 21% - well above the 12% minimum I generally require for such trades, which is dictated by the fact that selling a put involves the risk that the put seller may be compelled to purchase the underlying stock. An equity risk deserves an equity-like rate of return. DISCLOSURES: None.

2025-12-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Why Michael Saylor's Strategy could hold the key for the whole bitcoin market,"As bitcoin wobbles, all eyes are on Strategy . The company, which is the largest public treasury holder of bitcoin, wields considerable power to kneecap the asset's price if it liquidates some of its holdings. But the firm is unlikely to have to sell its bitcoin if it can keep its enterprise value to cryptocurrency holdings ratio above a key level, according to JPMorgan. Strategy should keep the ratio of its enterprise value — or the summation of its market capitalization, debts, preferreds and equity dividends — to bitcoin holdings above 1.0 to avoid a forced sale of the digital assets on its balance sheet, JPMorgan analysts said Wednesday in a note to clients. The company's ratio stood at 1.13 as of Wednesday, according to the note. And that in turn, could stem the recent pressure in bitcoin that's troubled financial markets this month. ""If this ratio stays above 1.0 and MicroStrategy can eventually avoid selling bitcoins, markets will likely be reassured and the worst for bitcoin prices will likely be behind us,"" JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. Strategy stock has cratered, with shares down roughly 42% over the past three months amid a broader crypto market downturn. Its plunge into the red has stoked investors' fears that Strategy might sell some of its tokens, putting even more downward pressure on bitcoin. The largest crypto by market capitalization has struggled lately, dipping below $85,000 on Monday to its lowest level since March — off more than 30% from its all time high just north of $126,000 hit in early October. Bitcoin has rebounded to about $92,600 as of writing time, although it remains down slightly over the year-to-date, leading investors to wring their hands over the token's trajectory. BTC.CM= MSTR 3M mountain Bitcoin vs. Strategy, 3 months Adding to traders' jitters, Strategy has already reduced the size of its bitcoin buys. The firm purchased 9,062 bitcoins last month, or far fewer than the 134,480 tokens it added to its balance sheet during the same month a year prior. And, Morgan Stanley Capital International is reportedly considering excluding Strategy from its indices next year — a move that could lead to outflows of as much as $8.8 billion, according to J.P. Morgan. To be sure, analysts noted that Strategy has created a $1.4 billion reserve fund for future dividend and interest payments, which could help the firm avoid forced selling if bitcoin plunges further into the red.",['Liz Napolitano']

2025-12-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Salesforce earnings are doing little to break stock out of slump. Some major analysts think a big AI rally is ahead,"After a massive year-to-date slump, some analysts see a huge buying opportunity ahead for Salesforce . Wall Street firms seemed optimistic after the cloud-based software giant posted fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings that came in at $3.25 per share, exceeding the $2.86 consensus estimate from LSEG. The company also guided for current-quarter revenue of between $11.13 billion to $11.23 billion. This topped Wall Street's estimate of $10.9 billion. Investors this morning were less enthused than analysts with shares up only 1.8% in early trading. The stock has declined 29% this year. CRM 5D mountain CRM 5D chart Despite these mixed earnings, some major Wall Street analysts believe the stock could surge as much as 70% from here, pointing to AI-driven acceleration as a catalyst. ""Something has to give, CRM is very bullish about the broad based AI momentum it is seeing and eventually this should help revenue growth. Higher sales capacity should also help. However, investors seem to remain skeptical about the growth trajectory. We see this as a buying opportunity,"" wrote Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow. Here's what some of Wall Street's biggest shops had to say on the report. Bernstein: underperform rating, $223 price target Bernstein's target, up from $221, implies about 7% downside from Salesforce's Wednesday close of $238.72. ""We have been concerned that Salesforce is a mature business in a mature market. While valuation has come down and expectation around AgentForce is being adjusted, we continue to worry about the longer term share loss risk from being the biggest incumbent in the CRM market, as well as the potential of big expensive M & A's considering the hot M & A market and the company's acquisitive history."" UBS: neutral, $260 UBS' forecast corresponds to upside of around 9%. ""Net, the reported numbers didn't hint at any near-term acceleration although Salesforce said that under the hood, bookings are improving enough such that sub/ support revs growth should soon trough and accelerate in 2H FY27. We're content staying patient on the stock until we can more clearly see a path back to 10%+ growth."" Wells Fargo: equal weight, $265 Wells Fargo's target calls for 11% upside going forward. ""Our estimates move higher mostly to incorporate INFA acquisition. Organic numbers largely unchanged, keeping us balanced until we gain more evidence to corroborate the anticipated Agentforce-led acceleration in 12-18 months."" Bank of America: buy, $305 Analyst Brad Sills' forecast is 28% above Salesforce's Thursday closing price. ""A key investor question for Salesforce is whether the company is winning or losing in AI. While Q3 did not put the debate to rest, key growth metrics lend credibility to the bull case that an AI driven acceleration is coming. It helps when the company delivers cRPO upside (11% growth cc versus guidance for 9%). While AI revenue didn't contribute meaningfully (Agentforce + Data 360 revenue ramped $200 million q/q), a number of deal metrics suggest that AI is likely to become more material in FY27."" Barclays: overweight, $330 The bank's target equates to 38% upside. ""Ramped sales reps will be +15% YoY by the year end, so unless there will be significantly lower sales productivity going forward, this should help overall future bookings growth. Equally, the Agentforce and Data Cloud AI momentum should eventually show up in cRPO (FY27) and then with a lag effect in subscription revenue. Management enthusiasm and our checks suggests that we should see better times ahead and hence we maintain our Overweight rating and are raising our PT to $330."" JPMorgan: overweight: $365 JPMorgan's price target implies upside of 53%. ""Our sense is that Q3 results support the bookings momentum embedded in Salesforce's long-term framework, including the $60B+ organic revenue and Rule-of-50 ambitions outlined at Dreamforce. Coupled with continued emphasis on Agentforce and Data 360, a higher FY26 cash flow outlook, substantial share repurchase activity, and sustained strength in free cash flow per share growth, we view Q3 as supportive of the eventual reacceleration formula despite the atypical top-line shortfall."" Goldman Sachs: buy, $385 The bank's forecast is 61% higher than where shares of Salesforce currently trade. ""The stock is indicated +2% AH as investors credit strengthening AI momentum, adding confidence that Salesforce can deliver on the revenue reacceleration path outlined at the Oct. Investor Day … We believe that Salesforce remains poised to be one of the most strategic application software companies in the $1tn+ TAM cloud industry and is on a path to $50bn in revenue."" Morgan Stanley: overweight, $405 Morgan Stanley's target implies a 70% upside from here. ""A bigger beat and slight acceleration in cRPO, coupled with an impressive ramp in Agentforce metrics, reinforce the theme of building momentum we heard at the Analyst Day. While it may take a few more data points for a skeptical investor base to come on board, at 13X EV/CY27 FCF, we are buyers here.""",['Lisa Kailai Han']
2025-12-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,JPMorgan says the time is right to buy this fintech stock that had a poor 2025,"After underperforming for the majority of the year, JPMorgan believes that the tide will turn for Toast , which provides point-of-sale services to restaurants. The bank upgraded the fintech stock to an overweight rating from neutral. JPMorgan also set a price target of $43, which is approximately 22% higher than Toast's Wednesday close of $35.17. Shares of Toast have slipped 4% in 2025. JPMorgan analysts led by Tien-tsin Huang said that this year-to-date underperformance has offered up an opportunity to turn more overweight. TOST YTD mountain TOST YTD chart Huang argued that Toast now checks several boxes that he likes, including an ""enviable combination of forecasted growth and adjusted EBITDA margin"" next year. Huang sees an upside to current valuation if Toast demonstrates it can successfully stack total addressable markets such as retail food and beverage, enterprise and international at an attractive return on investment level. ""We see TOST maintaining top decile growth as a bonafide software-led payments leader unburdened by legacy distribution/tech that is stacking [total addressable markets] using a proven playbook with expense discipline to deliver $977M in 2027E EBITDA,"" he wrote. Huang also applauded Toast's modern platform and unique brand affinity among restaurants. ""We like Toast as a disruptive player in a restaurant industry that is overdue for IT modernization, and we appreciate the strong, organic brand it has developed, particularly in the SMB end of the market,"" he said. Huang's 20% recurring gross profit growth forecast captures his view that Toast should continue to see high win rates and gain deeper market penetration. The company's accelerating growth momentum also warrants its high price target, he added. ""Our target multiple values TOST ahead of its high-growth peers (e.g. BILL, CHYM, KLAR, RELY) and in-line with PAY (N-rated), which we think gives TOST credit for its premium growth record, recognizing it competes in a highly competitive category,"" Huang said. ""TOST is among the fastest growers in the comp group from FY24-28E with materially improving profitability, justifying a lofty multiple and supporting our Overweight rating.""",['Lisa Kailai Han']
2025-12-03 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Dan Niles says his best idea right now is cash. Here's what else he likes,"In a market that could soon be topping out, the best investment idea right now is cash, according to Dan Niles, founder of Niles Investment Management. The market moved higher on Wednesday, but Microsoft shares fell after The Information reported the company was slashing software sales quotas tied to artificial intelligence. Microsoft denied the report . Several other AI-related names sank in sympathy. Shares of Alphabet , however, rose nearly 2%. The moves were the latest in the autumn's volatile AI trade, which started after investors began to grow concerned over sky-high valuations. ""The market is starting to go, 'you know everybody is not going to win so I need to start differentiating between the Google complex of companies and the OpenAI complex of companies and go, how many winners are there actually going to be. Maybe there will be two or three; it is not going to be 10,'"" Niles said in an interview on CNBC's "" Power Lunch ."" ""That is why this market feels fragile."" Within tech, he thinks Alphabet-owned Google will be among those that come out on top in the AI race . Alphabet recently released its Gemini 3 AI model and its latest custom silicon chip. GOOGL YTD mountain Alphabet year to date Another interesting stock right now is Apple , Niles said. While it doesn't have a particularly great AI product right now, that will change. ""Next year you are going to have a good product with AI on the system and you are going to have a foldable phone,"" he said. Still, with the market broadening out to other sectors, the best thing investors can do is stay diversified — especially since the now-rocky AI trade and Federal Reserve rate cuts have been what's been pushing the market to new highs. The market is pricing in 89% odds of another rate cut at the conclusion of the central bank's two-day meeting December 10, according to the CME FedWatch tool . However, Niles doesn't expect any more cuts after that until a new Fed chair is installed in May. ""You have to start thinking a little bit more,"" he said. ""If you are concerned that December 10 might be the top because that is the last rate cut for the next five months, other than being broadly diversified, cash is not a bad option.""",['Michelle Fox']
2025-12-03 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Hightower’s Stephanie Link says market is failing to appreciate Microsoft's AI value,"As concerns around elevated valuations persist, Hightower Advisors' Stephanie Link is finding investment opportunities in underappreciated technology stocks such as Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks . Link, who recently said that investors are navigating the second inning of the artificial intelligence trade, appeared on CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on Wednesday to give her takes on some of the biggest tech names. The chief investment strategist and portfolio manager highlighted one Big Tech name that is underperforming the broader market this year despite its scale, strong bookings and margin growth. She's also watching winners and losers in the hot cybersecurity industry. Here are the names Link is watching: Microsoft Microsoft shares are up more than 14% this year, but the stock has lost roughly 11% since it reported fiscal first-quarter results in late October and warned capital expenditures would accelerate this fiscal year. The stock, which is considered a proxy for interest in OpenAI's ChatGPT model, has also been hit by concerns about Google's success with its Gemini 3 AI model. And it was dealt another blow Wednesday after The Information said the company's AI products were missing growth goals . Microsoft has pushed back on the report, saying it hasn't lowered sales quotas. The market isn't appreciating some of Microsoft's growth opportunities, according to Link, who recently opened a position in the tech giant. The disappointment over the latest earnings report ""is ridiculous for a company of this size,"" Link said, noting how its operating margins have expanded. ""I know it's a crowded name, but I just think that that's the opportunity,"" she said. ""I care more about the ecosystem at large at this company, and they are participating in the fast growth of AI and I don't think it's really appreciated. The multiple has contracted five multiple points from its average."" Snowflake Link continues to favor Snowflake , which has soared more than 73% this year on optimism that the cloud data storage company is benefiting from the AI race. ""This is one name that I think is a very big beneficiary from all of the data that has been created and needs to be cleaned for the companies in data centers and in AI to work,"" Link said. She said she prefers Snowflake to other software names such as Salesforce and Adobe, which ""are expensive for the growth that you're getting."" However, the company has set a high bar for itself. In late October, the company reaffirmed its third-quarter and fiscal 2026 guidance . Link said she suspects Snowflake will need to beat revenue growth estimates and improve margins to drive the stock further given its recent run-up. ""I think of you have the top line and you got the margins, you're gonna get the operating leverage on the bottom line."" Palo Alto Networks Link recommended investors own Palo Alto Networks for a leg up in the cybersecurity industry. She prefers it to CrowdStrike, which she said is bigger but more expensive. ""The one I have been buying and I recommend to buy here is Palo Alto, because that stock is only up 3% year to date,"" Link said. According to Link, the stock's performance has been hurt by recent acquisitions it's made. ""I think people are nervous about the integration risk,"" she said. ""If there's any management that can get this thing done, it's this management team."" Palo Alto announced in July that it will take over Israeli identity security provider CyberArk in a deal worth about $25 billion . Then, in mid-November it said it would acquire observability platform Chronosphere for $3.35 billion. These deals followed plans in April to buy Protect AI for between $650 million and $700 million as part of its strategy to push into securing AI and machine learning applications and models. The acquisitions are ""positive for the long term,"" Link said.","['Pia Singh', 'In']"

Historically, consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks have been ""standout outperformers"" after the central bank starts lowering, or resumes a cycle of interest rate reductions, Evercore analysts said in a note to clients last weekend. Interest rate futures prices suggest about a 90% probability that the Fed will cut rates another quarter percentage point, to 3.50%-3.75%, at its last meeting of the year next week, the CME FedWatch tool shows. The Fed also eased policy in September and October, after three reductions in late 2024. ""While this cutting cycle has been different given the extended pause, the 'Tariff Tantrum', the dominance of the 'AI Revolution' and the 'K-shaped Economy,' the historical evidence is clear – both Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors are standout outperformers on a 6- and 12 month basis once the Fed cutting cycle starts, or in this case, has restarted,"" the analysts wrote in their note. Next week's expected rate cut adds to other tailwinds for consumer stocks, including the tax cuts embedded in last summer's Big Beautiful Bill that could eventually stimulate consumer spending and the chance for ""tariff rebate"" checks.

2025-12-03 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"Transports are breaking out. This delivery giant in the space deserves close attention, charts show","The iShares IYT Transportation Average ETF (IYT) doesn't get much attention, but that may change soon. This morning, it's breaking out of a multimonth bullish pattern. That's notable because — according to Dow Theory — we want the transportation average to confirm any major move or breakout in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The logic is straightforward: If companies that make the goods are thriving, the companies that transport those goods should be busy as well. Strong activity in transportation is a classic sign of a healthy economy, which in turn supports continued strength in industrial companies. Of course, the structure of the economy has evolved dramatically over the past century since this market principle first became popular. But the underlying idea remains useful: The more areas of the market participating in a move to the upside, the more healthy and sustainable that move tends to be. We're going to look at a few charts today, but the big takeaway is that persistent breakouts from patterns across multiple timeframes are unusual — and when they appear, they deserve our attention. The first one is the daily chart, where IYT has been knocking on the door of a breakout above the 73-level ever since it first revisited that area in July. Despite several failed attempts, IYT continued to hold close to the highs. That persistence has been a constructive sign. Then came the broad market snapback in late November, which helped fuel today's breakout through that zone, as indicated on the chart. This breakout now triggers a measured-move target up into the 80-zone, which would be meaningfully above its 2025 high and even above the all-time high from 2024, shown on the next chart. This weekly chart stretches all the way back to late 2022. When look at the entire decline from late 2024 through the April crash lows and then the recovery over the past several months, the entire structure can be categorized as a massive bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. While the theoretical measured-move target from a pattern of this size would be much higher, this isn't about making outlandish projections. The key point is that additional follow-through from here wouldn't just confirm the larger pattern breakout — it could also put IYT into new all-time-high territory, which at this point isn't far away. The real question then becomes: If and when that happens, how much more upside can we reasonably expect? We can start to answer that by looking at this 20-year, monthly chart. We can categorize this entire period as a series of four major bullish patterns. The previous three all resolved decisively to the upside, each followed by months — often years — of additional upside follow-through. Those breakouts occurred in 2012, 2017 and 2020 and, in every case, the eventual consolidation only served to create another bullish structure. The latest iteration has taken shape since mid-2021, meaning we're essentially looking at a four-year bullish formation that IYT may now be breaking out of. Given both the length and height of this pattern, one could reasonably argue that not only is a new all-time high achievable, but that IYT could extend much further and for much longer if the long-term behavior of the past two decades repeats. Looking more specifically at IYTs 49 holdings, we see that ground transportation and air freight & logistics groups making up roughly 80% of the ETF. While many of the underlying names are already at — or approaching — new all-time highs, there is one highly recognizable laggard that deserves our attention going forward: UPS . UPS is the third-largest holding in IYT, with a weight of nearly 8%. And although it's rallying today, the bigger picture is hard to ignore: UPS has been in a waterfall decline ever since topping in early 2022. It has now fully retraced the entire rally off the COVID lows. This is a weekly chart along with its 40-week moving average, which closely aligns with the 200-day moving average. Despite multiple attempts to reclaim that line, every effort has failed, and this has become even more evident throughout 2024. Of course, each failed bounce carried the potential to evolve into a bullish pattern — but that has not yet materialized. If, however, at some point soon UPS can, in fact, break out of a bullish formation and regain and hold above the 40-week line, then IYT would gain another major component contributing to its upside momentum. This is why UPS should be watched closely in the weeks to months ahead. DISCLOSURES: None.

Burry's rare interview with Lewis, who authored ""The Big Short"" book about the investor's famous call on the housing market crash, come amid his recent focus on what he sees as a bubble forming around the AI trade. He said during the podcast that Palantir and other companies are doing ""consulting"" around AI rather than working directly on the technology, which can make their high valuations hard to justify. Burry — who recently deregistered his hedge fund and launched a Substack blog — said investors should consider selling holdings that have shot up during this run. He also warned that a slide in today's market would look different than during the dotcom bubble and lead to a more drawn-out decline, given that more regular investors today are passively invested in index funds and ETFs which are concentrated in AI names. ""I think the whole thing's just gonna come down,"" he said. ""It will be very hard to be in a long (on) stocks in the United States and protect yourself."" Specifically, Burry said Palantir should fall drastically from its current levels. The defense technology stock has surged nearly 130% in 2025 and has skyrocketed more than 2,100% over the last three years. Burry said he would instead pick up health care stocks in the current market. The S & P 500 's health care sector has added about 11% over the last three years, while the broader index has jumped just over 68% over the same time period. ""They're really out of favor,"" Burry said of the sector. Burry also chided Bitcoin , arguing that it holds no material value and has given way to a rise in illegal behaviors. The digital currency rose above the $92,500 level on Wednesday following a recent bout of volatility. ""It's a tulip bulb of our time,"" Burry said. But, ""it's worse than a tulip bulb because this has enabled so much criminal activity.""",['Alex Harring']
2025-12-03 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,These stocks could be added to the S&P 500 when benchmark reshuffles this month,"The S & P 500 could see one more big reshuffle before the year ends, with fourth-quarter changes to the benchmark stock index expected on Friday, Dec. 19. In a Wednesday note to clients, Stephens analyst Melissa Roberts pointed to three potential candidates that could get added to the benchmark in the next rebalance. ""The most likely eligible adds could be 400 migrators — [ Comfort Systems ] (Industrials), [ Pure Storage ] (IT), and [ Ciena ] (IT) are the three-largest 400 members,"" she wrote, referring to the S & P Midcap 400 index consisting of companies smaller than those in the S & P 500. Other candidates for potential inclusion due to their size include Carvana , CRH , Vertiv Holdings , Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Ares Management , she added. However, Roberts noted that there may be few, if any discretionary changes given that the fourth quarter had the lowest historical rebalance turnover, and that a strong M & A pipeline exists for changes. ""We believe any changes will focus on index clean-up and migrating oversized and undersized existing members,"" she wrote. ""New member market capitalization guidelines will likely move higher in early Jan. due to market strength, which may limit add opportunities for companies near current cut-offs."" An S & P Dow Jones Indices committee inside S & P Global makes the final decision on whether to include a stock in the benchmark index, looking at a company's size, financial strength, the number of public shares available to be traded and how many shares change hands in an average day. The committee also looks at what business the company is in out of a desire to not skew the index too heavily toward one sector or another. Technology accounts for 34.6% of the index today, and communication services, which houses Alphabet and Meta Platforms , another 10.7%. Currently, companies must have at least a $23 billion market capitalization to even be eligible to join the S & P 500 when changes are made, according to Charles Schwab. Index changes are made either during regular quarterly adjustments or as a result of a corporate action, such as a merger or acquisition. Today, S & P Global says the largest stock in the S & P 500 has a market cap of $4.3 trillion while the smallest is worth just $5.5 billion. Goldman Sachs last year estimated that passive, stock index funds own an average of 26% of every stock in the S & P 500. When a stock is added or removed from the index, passive funds are forced to buy or sell shares of that company to keep its representation in the index intact. S & P Dow Jones Indices estimated in 2024 that $16 trillion in total assets under management was indexed or benchmarked to the S & P 500, with passively managed indexed assets comprising $9 trillion.","['Lisa Kailai Han Scott Schnipper', 'Lisa Kailai Han', 'Scott Schnipper']"

Using options to make money on potential declines,"Tesla (TSLA) continues to face a challenging phase of its business as margin pressure, intensifying global EV competition and unclear visibility on higher-margin software contributions continue to cloud the long-term earnings trajectory. While the company remains a dominant EV brand, deliveries are expected to decline this year, pricing power has eroded, and profitability has compressed despite record revenue. Competition from Chinese manufacturers — both domestically and abroad — continues to narrow Tesla's differentiation, while regulatory uncertainty and slowing global EV adoption add further strain. Meanwhile, autonomy and FSD monetization remain long dated, making it increasingly difficult for investors to justify a premium valuation during a period of decelerating demand and rising execution risk. Trade timing & outlook After rallying towards its 52- week high, TSLA has formed a double top at $470 and momentum has stalled. TSLA recently broke below its 50D SMA and retesting it as resistance, coupled with underperformance relative to the S & P 500. With poor relative performance and a potential shift in trend, our downside target is $330, providing a strong risk to reward for adding bearish exposure. Fundamentals Tesla's valuation remains significantly elevated relative to automotive peers despite weakening margins and slowing revenue growth: Forward PE ratio: 206.12x vs. industry average 10.65x Expected EPS Growth: 30.50% vs. industry average 9.70% Expected revenue growth: 9.17% vs. industry average 3.57% Net margins: 5.31% vs. industry average 2.92% Bearish thesis Margin compression despite revenue growth: Q3'25 results showed ~12% revenue growth but a ~40% decline in operating income, with pricing cuts and rising costs limiting the path back to mid-teens margins. Demand softness into 2025: Street projections call for full-year deliveries to decline despite Q3's strength, as tax-credit timing pull forward demand. Competitive pressure mounting: BYD, Xiaomi, NIO—are reshaping the global EV landscape with lower-cost models, faster refresh cycles that erodes Tesla's competitiveness across regions. Uncertain autonomy monetization: FSD licensing interest from other automakers remains limited, and regulatory frameworks restrict full-feature deployment. International expansion risk: New markets such as India require careful pricing to reach economic parity; missteps could result in underwhelming volume growth or prolonged operating losses. Options trade With an IV Rank of 4%, options remain inexpensive for buying downside exposure using puts. I'm buying the Jan 16, 2026 $425/$370 Put Vertical @ $17.48 debit. This entails: Buying the Jan 16, 2026 $425 Put @ $24.68 Selling the Jan 16, 2026 $370 Put @ $7.20 The maximum reward is $3,752 per contract if TSLA closes below $370 at expiration. The maximum risk is $1,748, per contract if TSLA closes above $425 at expiration. The breakeven point for this trade is $407.52. View this Trade with Updated Prices at OptionsPlay This options structure provides defined-risk bearish exposure that aligns with weakening margins, and a competitive landscape that continues to pressure Tesla's premium valuation. With the stock failing to regain an important technical level and business headwinds mounting, the setup supports a bearish thesis with a strong potential risk to reward. DISCLOSURES: None.

U.K. business chiefs urged Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves to ease energy costs and avoid raising the tax burden on corporate Britain as she prepares this year's budget.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 preliminarily closed in the green, with most sectors and major regional bourses mixed.

European stocks moved broadly higher on Friday but edged just above the flatline at the closing bell, with next week's Federal Reserve policy decision in focus.

Investors are awaiting the outcome of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week. Expectations of a quarter-percentage point cut have surged in the past two weeks, with money markets now pricing in an 87.1% chance of policymakers trimming their key interest rate, according to the CME's FedWatch tool.

Economic reports Friday brought news that core U.S. inflation for September — the most recent month for which data is available — was at 2.8%, or 0.1 percentage point below forecast, according to the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index. PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation forecasting metric.

At the same time, the University of Michigan's survey of consumers showed sentiment a bit brighter than expected in December while inflation expectations hit their lowest levels since January.

The central bank is also focused on a softening labor market – but data on Thursday showed U.S. jobless claims in the week to Nov. 29 fell 27,000 from the previous week and came in below estimates.

Monetary policy focus will turn back to Europe the following week, with the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, Sweden's Riksbank and Norway's Norges Bank all scheduled to publish their own interest rate decisions on Dec. 18.

Investors in Europe continue to monitor developments in U.S.-led negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, who held talks with a U.S. delegation in Moscow earlier this week, is currently on a state visit to India. CNBC reported on Thursday that European Union officials were looking at ways to use frozen Russian assets to provide further support to Kyiv – a move that Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said would be tantamount to an act justifying war.

In an interview with India Today, Putin warned that Russia will seize Ukraine's eastern Donbas region by force if Ukrainian troops do not withdraw.

In corporate news, shares of Swiss Re fell 6.5% by the end of the session, paring earlier losses that saw it occupy the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after the global reinsurer announced its 2026 financial targets. The company said it was targeting net profit of $4.5 billion, slightly higher than the minimum $4.4 billion it's targeting in 2025. It also said its targets include annual dividend per share growth of 7% or more over the next two years.

At the other end of the index, Greggs advanced 5.2% after JPMorgan published an optimistic note on the struggling British fast food and bakery chain, per reports.

The S&P 500 edged higher on Friday, securing its fourth straight winning day, as traders digested inflation data that could provide further incentive for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates next week

The broad market index closed 0.19% higher at 6,870.40, putting the index about 0.7% off its intraday record. Friday also marked its ninth positive session in 10. The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.31% to settle at 23,578.13, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 104.05 points, or 0.22%, to end the day at 47,954.99.

The market sorted through a fresh slate of economic releases Friday. The Commerce Department said that the core personal consumption expenditures price index for September – which was delayed due to the record-setting U.S. government shutdown – showed an annual rate of 2.8%, lower than the 2.9% Dow Jones estimate. Core PCE's 0.2% rise on the month was in line with expectations, as were the monthly and annual inflation readings for headline PCE.

Also on Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer survey, a report that provides a glimpse at sentiment as well as the view on inflation over the near and longer term, came in higher than expected for December.

The PCE report, which serves as the Fed's primary inflation gauge, gives the central bank its final inflation view before Wednesday's interest rate vote. With inflation being mild, jobs remains more in focus after recent reports showed signs of weakening in the labor market. Investors are hoping that this will influence the central bank to lower its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point when it announces the decision Wednesday.

Traders are pricing in an 87% chance of a cut next Wednesday, far higher than just a couple weeks ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The key fed funds futures rate is currently targeted between 3.75%-4%, trading near the high end of that range amid ongoing pressures in short-term funding markets.

""I think it really just solidifies what the market's already been pricing in, which is almost certainty of a cut for next week,"" David Krakauer, vice president of portfolio management at Mercer Advisors, told CNBC. ""If inflation does continue to stay somewhat relatively tame and [is] potentially decreasing, then what's the outlook for more rate cuts into early next year?""

With expectations running high for a rate cut, Krakauer doesn't necessarily believe that it will serve as a catalyst for stocks to move higher as the new year approaches. That said, he still thinks the market is in a healthy position for some upside, at least enough to reach new highs on the S&P 500.

""It may be a steady move, it may be a choppy move, but I certainly see the path for equities forward as being very positive,"" he said.

Stocks posted gains for the week. The S&P 500 finished up 0.3% week to date, while the Nasdaq and 30-stock Dow have added almost 1% and 0.5%, respectively.

Discovery 's film and streaming assets with ""heavy skepticism,"" a senior administration official told CNBC's Eamon Javers on Friday morning.

Netflix said Friday that it would acquire Warner Bros.' film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. The deal is subject to regulatory approval.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said, ""This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare.""

""A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,"" Warren said in a statement.

""Under Donald Trump, the antitrust review process has also become a cesspool of political favoritism and corruption,"" Warren said. ""The Justice Department must enforce our nation's anti-monopoly laws fairly and transparently — not use the Warner Bros. deal review to invite influence-peddling and bribery.""

Paramount Skydance had made multiple bids for the entirety of WBD, as opposed to a subset of the company's assets.

Paramount's final bid, which was received Thursday evening, was for $30 per share, all cash, CNBC previously reported.

Comcast also made a bid for WBD's film and streaming properties.

The New York Post on Thursday reported that, ""Paramount Skydance chief David Ellison met with Trump officials and key lawmakers in Washington DC on Wednesday to press his case against Warner Bros. Discovery's potential selection of Netflix as its merger partner.""

Ellison's billionaire father, Larry Ellison, is close to President Donald Trump.

On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Paramount, in a letter to lawyers for WBD, had warned that a sale to Netflix likely would ""never close"" because of regulatory challenges in the United States and overseas.

""Acquiring Warner's streaming and studio assets 'will entrench and extend Netflix's global dominance in a matter not allowed by domestic or foreign competition laws,' Paramount's lawyers wrote,"" the Journal reported.

Netflix's purchase of WBD's assets is expected to close, if approved by regulators, after WBD completes its previously planned spinout of Discovery Global, which is currently planned to occur in the third quarter of 2026.

Discovery Global would include the CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery channels.

A Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows that Netflix agreed to pay a $5.8 billion reverse break-up fee if the deal does not receive approval.

CNBC requested comment from Netflix, WBD, Paramount, and Comcast.

Trump, even before taking office for his first term in the White House, opposed a deal by AT&T to buy Time Warner, saying ""it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.""

After he took office, the Department of Justice in November 2017 sued in an effort to prevent the merger.

The DOJ lost that lawsuit, and the merger was closed in June 2018.

Before the 2024 presidential election, Trump opposed the then-proposed sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel of Japan. But after reentering the White House in January, Trump in June signed an executive order approving the merger, after the companies signed a national security agreement with the U.S. government.

The agreement gave the U.S. government a ""golden share"" in the merged company, which Trump claims gives a president ""total control.""

Experts said the share gives the government an outsized say in corporate governance.

Correction: A senior administration official said the Trump administration views the deal with 'heavy skepticism.' A previous version mischaracterized the official.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Moscow will take Ukrainian territory by force if Kyiv's troops do not withdraw, signaling rigidity over a key sticking point in peace talks. ""Either we liberate these territories by force of arms, or Ukrainian troops leave these territories,"" Putin, who is currently on a state visit to India, said in an interview with India Today. The comments, published by Russian state-controlled media, were translated by news agency Reuters and made in reference to Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Russia is estimated to control more than 80% of the Donbas, where fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists started long before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022. The war in the region first began in 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea — a peninsular in southern Ukraine. Capturing and officially annexing the Donbas region would enable Russia to create a land bridge to Crimea, a crucial military and trading hub for Moscow. Under occupation, so-called referendums have shown up to 99% of residents in parts of the Donbas region voted to join the Russian Federation. Those referendums have been widely criticized as sham votes by the international community. Putin's comments came after he held a five-hour meeting with U.S. delegates Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner — U.S. President Donald Trump's son in law — in Moscow on Tuesday. During Thursday's interview with India Today, Putin said Russia did not agree with some of the points outlined in the reworked U.S. peace proposals for Ukraine, labeling the negotiation process ""difficult work.""

'Unlikely any time soon'

The original 28-point peace plan — drawn up by Russian and American officials, with no input from Ukraine — reportedly included a requirement that Ukraine concede territory in the Donbas to Russia. It was redrafted following talks between the U.S. and Ukraine, whose president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that any peace deal must honor Ukrainian sovereignty. Marnie Howlett, a lecturer in Russian and East European politics at the University of Oxford, told CNBC on Friday that the war would only end when Russia stops attacking Ukraine. ""Given the Kremlin shows a lack of genuine interest in ending the conflict, no peace agreement is likely any time soon,"" she said. ""Russia has failed to take Donbas by force since 2014, as Ukrainians have made clear they will not accept the illegal capture of their territory. No 'deal' is possible without Ukrainians' support, and nearly 12 years of resistance show that they are unwilling to support territorial concessions.""

The Commission on Friday said breaches include ""the deceptive design of its 'blue checkmark', the lack of transparency of its advertising repository, and the failure to provide access to public data for researchers.""

The ruling follows a two-year investigation under the Digital Services Act (DSA), which was adopted in 2022 to regulate online platforms. The Commission said that failure to comply with the decision may lead to penalty payments.

""Deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU,"" said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy.

""With the DSA's first non-compliance decision, we are holding X responsible for undermining users' rights and evading accountability.""

X didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment. In a reply on X to a post from the European Commission, Musk wrote, ""Bulls---.""

Musk's social network now has 60 days to tell the Commission how it plans to address the issues with ""deceptive"" blue checkmarks, and 90 days to submit a plan to resolve the issues with its ads repository, and access to its public data for researchers.

""Failure to comply with the non-compliance decision may lead to periodic penalty payments,"" the Commission said in a statement.

The fine comes a day after the commission announced it would investigate whether Meta breached antitrust rules around a new policy on allowing AI providers' access to WhatsApp.

In recent months, the US has been pressuring Europe to soften, or abandon, its rules for big tech companies, including the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act and other AI regulations that are under consideration.","['Kai Nicol-Schwarz Lora Kolodny', 'Kai Nicol-Schwarz', 'In Kains', 'Lora Kolodny', 'In Lorakolodny']"

Investors ""need to find businesses where the franchises are not going to be challenged by the AI disruption itself and, at the same time, companies that could leverage the technology either through cost cutting, efficiencies, productivity, or indeed, incremental innovation,"" Girod said. Despite a recent slowdown, U.S. tech stocks have rallied this year, with the S & P 500 Information Technology Index up 24.8% year-to-date, compared with, which is up the S & P 500 Health Care Index 11.6%, and the Stoxx Europe 600 Health, up just 2.7%. AI is driving about 40% of the U.S. market, Girod said. Megacaps such as Alphabet , Meta and Microsoft are spending billions to build out data centers, and massive deals have been announced by OpenAI, Nvidia and others. 'The ultimate hedge against an AI correction' Pharma, which makes up the bulk of healthcare indexes, has recently seen overhangs removed. For now, companies can dodge tariffs by pledging investments in U.S. manufacturing, and President Donald Trump's most-favored-nation drug pricing turned out better than feared. ""The recovery in Pharma stocks could accelerate as visibility improves after this year's perfect storm and as the sector's longer-term structural themes regain traction (ageing demographics, obesity),"" Kepler Cheuvreux analysts wrote as they upgraded European healthcare to Strong Overweight from Overweight in their quarterly playbook published earlier this week. They said it ""could be the ultimate hedge against an AI correction in 2026.""",['Elsa Ohlen']

Visa, whose European headquarters is currently at Paddington in the west of London, has signed a 15-year, 300,000 square foot lease at One Canada Square in Canary Wharf, according to Canary Wharf Group. The firm will move in summer of 2028.

It follows news that JPMorgan intends to build a new 3 million square foot tower in the city's historic financial district, while HSBC , BBVA , Barclays , Citibank and others have recommitted to the area in 2025. British fintech Revolut also opened an office in the area in September.

Canary Wharf was hit particularly hard as the coronavirus pandemic fueled a move to hybrid and remote working. The Docklands Core submarket, which includes Canary Wharf, hit record high vacancy rates in the first quarter of 2025, at 18.5%, according to data from CoStar.

There are three main reasons for a resurgence of the district, Shobi Khan, CEO, Canary Wharf Group, told CNBC in September, at which point Canary Wharf's vacancy rate was 6%.

First is the convenience of the Elizabeth line railway, which has provided access to the area that has ""never been better,"" as well as the fact the space is now multi-use, featuring residential home and hotels as well as offices.

""And lastly, real estate is about demand and supply. The construction pipeline is basically turning off after 2026 and so rents are being increased, we're pushing rents and getting the benefit of having limited space for occupants to look at,"" Khan said.

The Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery deal came together quickly — but its path to regulatory approval may not be so speedy. Netflix stunned the media industry on Friday when it announced its proposed $72 billion deal to acquire the iconic Warner Bros. film studio and streaming service HBO Max. The combination brings together two of the most popular streaming platforms in the business. Netflix reported 300 million global subscribers as of late 2024, the last time it reported the metric. HBO Max had 128 million customers as of Sept. 30. Netflix currently claims 46% of mobile app monthly active users in global streaming, according to data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Combined with HBO Max, that share would rise to 56%, it found. ""This deal cements Netflix's position as the premier streaming service for original content,"" according to a research note from analysts at William Blair on Friday. The size of the deal makes it ripe for scrutiny, from both industry insiders and U.S. lawmakers. The Trump administration is viewing the merger with ""heavy skepticism,"" CNBC reported Friday, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already called for an antitrust review. ""This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare. A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,"" Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said in a statement. The merger would also give Netflix control over the famed Warner Bros. film studio, further consolidating the cinematic space and raising concerns that the number or typical windowing of popular releases could shrink. It's typical in the days and weeks following a deal announcement of this scale for interest groups, politicians and corporate competitors to call foul on antitrust grounds. The Department of Justice is most likely to review the deal, as it has other media mergers in the past, and it could take some time. DOJ reviews can take anywhere from months to more than a year. Netflix said Friday it expects the transaction to close in 12 to 18 months, after Warner Bros. Discovery spins out its portfolio of cable networks into Discovery Global.

Netflix confidence

Netflix executives on Friday said they were ""highly confident"" the deal would win regulatory approval. ""You know, this deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it's pro-creator, it's pro-growth,"" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during an investor call following the acquisition announcement. ""Our plans here are to work really closely with all the appropriate governments and regulators, but [we're] really confident that we're going to get all the necessary approvals that we need,"" Sarandos added. As part of the deal, Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee to Warner Bros. Discovery if the deal were to get blocked by the government. Netflix's bid won out over competing offers from Paramount Skydance and Comcast. Analysts at Deutsche Bank and William Blair were at least minimally convinced Friday of the potential for the deal to go through. ""A merger of Warner Bros. Discovery and any of the three bidders would probably succeed, even if the DOJ were to sue to block a proposed combination,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note on Friday, citing insights from a Department of Justice veteran who the analysts said ""does not see any significant antitrust problems with any of the three scenarios."" ""However ... we don't know all of the detailed facts that will be collected and analyzed by the DOJ, nor do we know who the judge hearing the case will be, and both of these factors can have an impact on the outcome,"" the Deutsche Bank analysts noted. Paramount, for its part, has been fanning the flames. Paramount's lawyers sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery this week, first reported by CNBC, in which it argued the sale process had been rigged in Netflix's direction. The Wall Street Journal reported that in a separate letter, Paramount said a Netflix transaction would likely ""never close"" because of regulatory headwinds. Paramount was the only bidder looking to buy WBD's massive portfolio of pay-TV networks — and it's unlikely to walk away from the process quietly.

The U.K. was the birthplace of commercial nuclear energy, but now generates just a fraction of its power from it — big investments are underway to change that. The country once had more nuclear power stations than the U.S., USSR and France — combined. It was a global producer until 1970 but hasn't completed a new reactor since Sizewell B in 1995. Today, the country takes the crown not for being a leader in atomic energy, but for being the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear projects. Nuclear energy accounted for just 14% of the U.K.'s power supply in 2023, according to the most recent data from the International Energy Agency, trailing its European peers and well behind frontrunner France at 65%. There is ambition to change that and have a quarter of the U.K.'s power come from nuclear by 2050. Nuclear is considered an attractive bet gas it's a low-carbon, constant energy source that can act as a baseload to complement intermittent sources like renewables. ""There's a very clear momentum that has been observed,"" Doreen Abeysundra, founder of consultancy Fresco Cleantech, told CNBC. It's in part due to geopolitical tensions, which pushed energy security and independence onto public agendas. However, the U.K.'s Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce called for urgent reforms after identifying ""systemic failures"" in the country's nuclear framework. It found that fragmented regulation, flawed legislation and weak incentives led the U.K. to fall behind as a nuclear powerhouse. The government committed to implementing the taskforce's guidance and is expected to present a plan to do so within three months.

Going big – or small

The U.K. is spreading its bets across tried-and-tested large nuclear projects and smaller, next-generation reactors known as small module reactors (SMRs). British company Rolls-Royce has been selected as the country's preferred partner for SMRs, which are effectively containerized nuclear reactors designed to be manufactured in a factory. Many include passive cooling techniques, which supporters argue makes them safer and cheaper. Nuclear has long come under fire by environmentalists due to radioactive waste and disasters like Chernobyl. Indeed, the U.K.'s first commercial plant Windscale became its worst nuclear accident in history when it melted down in 1957.

On October 10, 1957, Windscale became the site of the worst nuclear accident in British history, and the worst in the world until Three Mile Island 22 years later. A facility had been built there to produce plutonium, but when the US successfully designed a nuclear bomb that used tritium, the facility was used to produce it for the UK. However, this required running the reactor at a higher temperature than its design could sustain, and it eventually caught fire.

Most SMRs use light water reactor technology – think of the planned large-scale nuclear plant Sizewell C, just ""shrunk down,"" said Abeysundra – which is tried and tested. Other designs, known as ""advanced"" reactors, are more experimental. For example, those that change the cooling solution or solvent, which is typically used in the process of separating and purifying nuclear materials. The U.K.'s first SMR will be at Wylfa, in Wales, though no timeline has been given for its completion. The site will house three SMRs and grow over time. In September, the country signed a deal with the U.S. to enable stronger commercial ties on nuclear power and streamline licensing for firms that want to build on the opposite side of the Atlantic. However, ""the first thing is, there is not, at the moment, a single SMR actively producing electricity under four revenues. They will all come at best in the 30s,"" Ludovico Cappelli, portfolio manager of Listed Infrastructure at Van Lanschot Kempen, told CNBC. While SMRs are a ""game changer"" thanks to their ability to power individual factories or small towns, their days of commercial operation are too far away, he said. From an investment standpoint, ""that is still a bit scary,"" he added. To secure the large baseloads needed to offset the intermittency of renewables, ""we're still looking at big power stations,"" added Paul Jackson, Invesco's EMEA global market strategist.

SMRs ""probably"" do have a role — ""they can clearly be more nimble"" — but it will take time to roll them out, Jackson said, casting doubt on the U.K.'s ability to be a leader in nuclear, as France and China are already miles ahead. The U.K. government body Great British Energy-Nuclear is set to identify sites for an additional large-scale plant, having already acquired one in Gloucestershire, in the west of England, as well as the site in Wales. ""We are reversing a legacy of no new nuclear power being delivered to unlock a golden age of nuclear, securing thousands of good, skilled jobs and billions in investment,"" a spokesperson for the U.K. government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero told CNBC. ""Sizewell C will deliver clean electricity for the equivalent of six million of today's households for at least six decades, and the UK's first small modular reactors at Wylfa will power the equivalent of three million homes, bringing energy security,"" they added.

Innovation in funding

The U.K. has a strong legacy to build on. It pioneered fresh funding mechanisms to make large-scale nuclear projects investible so that they are less reliant on direct government funding, such as a Contract for Differences, which was used for Hinkley Point C. The mechanism guarantees a fixed price for the electricity generated over a long period of time in order to de-risk investments in an industry that's known for running over time and budget. Hinkley Point C was initially expected to cost £18 billion (over $24 billion) but the bill has slowly crept up. ""That fixes one part of the equation, the price risk,"" Cappelli said of nuclear investments, but the second risk is construction delays. The Regulated Asset Base (RAB), first used for nuclear at Sizewell C, attempts to reconcile this. Investors get paid from the day they cut a check for a nuclear project, rather than the day it starts operating. Sizewell C is expected to cost £38 billion to build. Private market investors are increasingly interested in next-generation nuclear as a way to offset soaring energy demands from AI, resulting in a host of young companies trying to build out facilities. Perhaps the most famous is Oklo, a U.S. firm that was taken public by a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) founded by OpenAI's Sam Altman.

The U.K.'s advanced modular reactor hopeful Newcleo, which uses lead for cooling, moved its headquarters from London to Paris in 2024 — a strategic move to deepen its European footprint. At the time, it told World Nuclear News that it still plans to have a commercial reactor up and running in the U.K. by 2033, but the firm has since scaled back its British efforts. Meanwhile, Tokamak Energy and First Light Fusion call the U.K. home. They both focus on nuclear fusion, the process of generating power by combining atoms, though this technology is yet to get out of the lab. All of today's nuclear power comes from fission, where atoms are spit. The U.K. announced £2.5 billion for a world-first fusion prototype in June.

The next generation of engineers

The U.K. faces challenges in access to relevant talent, which is crucial for scaling projects effectively. The country is heralded for its world-class universities and technical know-how, ""but that is very much book knowledge,"" said Van Lanschot Kempen's Cappelli. ""What we need is real on-the-ground expertise, and that we are probably lacking for the simple reason that we haven't been doing it for a very long time,"" he said. For Abeysundra, there's one area where the U.K. stands out: its mindset. ""There is so much knowledge, innovation, and that can-do attitude, which I don't see as much in other nations,"" she said, pointing to the U.K.'s trailblazing role in the Industrial Revolution and establishment of offshore wind energy.

watch now

The U.K. government positioned nuclear energy as a key element of the future clean energy workforce in its Clean Energy Jobs Plan released in October, while its national roadmap for nuclear skills, set out in 2024, focuses on apprenticeships, PhDs and upskilling mid-career workers. Industry-led initiatives such as the Energy Skills Passport also support the likes of oil and gas workers to gain green skills.

Securing the supply chain

Perhaps the toughest issue, however, is the supply chain. Uranium, the fuel used to make a nuclear reaction, is dominated by just four countries, including Russia. Global demand for uranium could rise by nearly a third by 2030 and more than double by 2040, according to the World Nuclear Association, adding further reliance on a select few countries and pressure on developers.

2025-12-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,'Terrifying': Why U.S. senator in top intel post wants more spying on Chinese companies,"Through subsidiaries, BGI says it operates in the U.S. Europe, and Japan. In several countries, it helped built national genetic databases and pandemic testing systems .

The company began as a Beijing-based research entity, the Beijing Genomics Institute, tied closely to China's national genome projects. It later expanded into a global commercial powerhouse, selling DNA sequencing, prenatal testing, cancer screening, and large-scale population genetic analysis, according to an NBC News report.

BGI is one of the largest genomics companies in the world. It operates DNA sequencing laboratories in China and abroad. It processes genetic data for hospitals, pharmaceutical firms and researchers across dozens of countries, according to a recent report by the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology.

""If Huawei was big, BGI will be even bigger,"" Warner said at the CNBC CFO Council Summit in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday.

Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, is now worried about another Chinese company that he predicts will eclipse Huawei in both scale and consequence: BGI. It is not building cell towers or smartphones for the 5G era. It is collecting DNA.

Go back a decade and most Americans had never heard of Huawei. Today, the Chinese telecom giant is a symbol of how quickly China can dominate a strategic technology sector and in the process create new national security and market threats for U.S. government and industry.

A man visits the booth of BGI at the Healthy Life Chain area of the third China International Supply Chain Expo CISCE in Beijing, capital of China, July 16, 2025.

One of the biggest fears tied to BGI and China's broader biotech push is the possibility of a genetically enhanced soldier. U.S. officials have publicly claimed that China has explored human performance enhancement and military biotechnology. U.S. defense analysts say China's research spans population DNA collection, military databases, and AI-driven human performance modeling, according to a Wall Street Journal op-ed written by U.S. Director of the Central Intelligence Agency John Ratcliffe in 2020, when he was Director of National Intelligence during President Trump's first term.

Congressional investigators have previously warned that BGI maintains close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese military, according to a report from the House Select Committee on the CCP. They argue that China makes little distinction between commercial data and state security needs.

At the CNBC event this week, Warner continued to press for more focus on BGI. ""They are hoovering up DNA data,"" Warner said. ""This level of experimentation on humans and intellectual property theft, we all should be concerned about it.""

U.S. intelligence officials believe that global footprint gives BGI access to one the largest collections of genetic data on Earth. Lawmakers have warned that genetic data is not just medical information. At scale, it becomes a strategic asset spurring a ""DNA arms race,"" according to a Washington Post report. DNA profiles can reveal ancestry, physical traits, disease risk, and family relationships, and when linked with artificial intelligence, the data can also be used for surveillance, tracking and long-term biological research tied to national security, according to the Washington Post's reporting.

Warner described China as a great nation and great competitor, and as a former telecom executive (he was among the founders of Nextel), he said what Huawei was able to execute on — producing good products at inexpensive prices before the U.S. and Western competitors were prepared — is a cautionary tale.

The BGI story looks uncomfortably familiar to Warner.

""Go back in time eight or nine years, and most people had never heard of Huawei,"" he said.

Huawei rose by combining massive state support, global market access and aggressive pricing, not only outcompeting Western firms on scale and cost, but positioning itself inside the world's telecom infrastructure before governments understood the security implications. Huawei was first placed on a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019, which banned U.S. firms from selling some technology to the Chinese tech giant over national security concerns. Chip restrictions on Huawei have since become even stricter.

But Warner said by the time the U.S. moved to restrict Huawei, ""[we started to] lose a little.""

Much of the 5G backbone had already been shaped by Chinese technology.

During a separate interview with Javers at the CNBC CFO Council Summit, the Republican Chairman of the House committee on the Chinese Communist Party, Michigan congressman John Moolenaar, said ""We've seen how they run the play of excess capacity, price manipulation, driving people out of business in different areas; they're going to continue to run that play,"" he said. ""We want to be friendly with China, but China is not our friend. They are our foremost adversary,"" he added.

The Soviet Union was a military and ideological competitor, but China, in tech domain after domain, Warner says — from telecom and 5G to AI, quantum computing and biotech — is a different kind of competitor.

Warner now sees BGI following a similar model in biotechnology. Like Huawei, BGI scaled rapidly with state support. The Washington, D.C.-based think tank Foundation of Defense of Democracies called upon lawmakers of both parties earlier this year to restrict BGI's access to U.S. institutions.

Congress has been trying to pass various versions of the BIOSECURE Act, which would limit the ability of Chinese biotechs to operate in the U.S. Some U.S. hospitals and research institutions with ties to Chinese genomics firms are under federal pressure, according to the Associated Press, though some medical professionals within the U.S. say they risk losing key research support for core medical goals. BGI told the AP that the bill is ""a false flag targeting companies under the premise of national security. We strictly follow rules and laws, and we have no access to Americans' personal data in any of our work,"" it said.

U.S. intel has moved too slowly, and disrupted key spying alliances

Warner said the U.S. intelligence apparatus has moved too slowly to recognize the biotech threat. He says that intelligence agencies focus too much on foreign governments and militaries, with less attention placed on commercial technology sectors. But in a world where technology supremacy is national security, Warner says more of our intelligence efforts need to reflect this shift.

Only in the past two to three years, he says, has the U.S. seriously expanded spying into AI, semiconductors, and biotechnology. Warner says we need a more ""advanced approach"" in this area, and he gave as one recent example when China's largest chipmaker SMIC stunned U.S. officials by producing a six-nanometer chip despite sweeping U.S. export controls. The breakthrough showed that Washington had underestimated both China's technical qualities and ability to work around restrictions. ""We got caught off guard with the SMIC six-nanometer chip,"" Warner said.

Warner is also worried that tracking China's tech rise requires a type of deep cooperation with U.S. allies that the Trump administration has squandered, such as the global intelligence-sharing network called the ""Five Eyes"" alliance.

Those relationships are now under strain, he said, and key partners including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France have gone public in saying they are reluctant to share intel with the U.S. ""They feel like we may be politicizing the intel product and that is not good news for America,"" Warner said.

Underlying his concerns about the technology competition with China in areas including AI and biotech is the U.S. ceding the global lead in standards setting. For decades, the U.S. shaped the rules for wireless networks, satellites, and internet infrastructure. That dominance help Americans lead global markets, Warner said, but now China is aggressively positioning itself as the international standards setter.

Warner described the U.S. role in international bodies as one of the ""secret sauces"" in the era of America's dominance of the global economy and technology, allowing the U.S. to leverage innovations occurring around the globe, ""even if it didn't arise in America.""

Across technology domains, influencing standards and protocols is critical to not only maintaining a competitive edge but also establishing ethical boundaries. ""Will it be us or the Chinese?"" Warner said. ""The Chinese come in with clearly a less humanist approach. It's been effective in lots of domains. We see it on standards-setting bodies. China floods the zone with lots of engineers, almost buying off the votes. We've got to reengage for American business and government,"" he said.

Many major financial goals, such as saving for retirement and paying down debt, are predicated on your ability to consistently save a portion of your income, Benz says. ""If you are saving reasonably, it obviates the need to do a lot of other things,"" she says. ""Even if you make subpar decisions about investment selections, for example, if the savings rate is decent, it addresses a lot of things that might not be perfect in the plan."" Put simply, consistently investing 20% of your income into a below average portfolio will likely get you a better outcome than putting 5% in and earning above-average returns. If you want to keep things really simple, try a strategy Benz uses known as reverse budgeting. Rather than trying to tinker with your spending to optimize your savings rate, pick a flat percentage of your income — Benz says 15% is a good target — and set that money to automatically come out of each paycheck to be put toward financial goals. The rest of the money is yours to spend as you see fit.

Index investing

Theoretically, someone picking the right investments at the right time can beat the stock market over the long term. In practice, though, it's really tough to do. Consider the managers of large-company U.S. stock funds, whose job it is to beat the S&P 500. Over the decade ended June 2025, just 8% of those mutual funds survived and beat the benchmark, according to Morningstar. That's why Benz recommends building a core portfolio of index funds, which come with low fees and merely track the performance of market indexes rather than trying to beat them. ""A lot of data point to the fact that index funds are really terrific choices, and they're hands off,"" she says. ""They can give you exposure to a lot of different parts of the stock and bond market with a single holding."" ""To me, index funds are a great intersection of optimization and the 'good enough' portfolio.""

Simplifying financial relationships

No one wants to park their cash in an account that offers practically no interest. But you needn't move your money around in search of a few tenths of a percentage point either, Benz says. ""It drives me crazy — the idea of people running around trying to get the best cash instrument,"" she says. ""The best way to tip things in your favor is to go with a low-cost provider that will deliver a persistently competitive yield."" In the context of a brokerage, that may mean comparing what you'll get on so-called ""sweep accounts"" — the places where your money sits within your brokerage account when it's not invested, she says. For high-yield savings accounts, it pays to remember that rates fluctuate, Benz says. It will probably be less of a headache to stick with a bank that you like and that pays a generous rate rather than ping-ponging between online banks offering the highest rate of the year. And if that bank or brokerage also offers credit cards with rewards you like, all the better, she says. When it comes time for you or someone else to get hands-on with your money, having more of it under one roof tends to make things more manageable. ""Reducing the number of financial relationships is such a good practice, which doesn't mean you want to be completely lazy,"" she says. ""But if you can try to skinny down the number of entities that you need to connect with, it's good all around.""

2025-12-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,S&P 500 quietly rebounds to near a new record. Where to next after a quick round trip?,"There are quiet weeks on Wall Street but there are no meaningless ones. The broad S & P 500 index in the past week barely fluttered the curtains, tiptoeing higher by 0.3%, slowing its two-week, 5.5% rebound rally and finishing just a quarter-percent shy of its former closing high set on Oct. 28. The smooth, if slow, progression reflects a market back in gear after running rough in November, with rotation among sectors supporting the tape and suppressing volatility, the S & P 500 Volatility Index bleeding toward 15 for the first time in almost six weeks. .SPX YTD mountain S & P 500, YTD Yet a close look and careful listen reveal a more emphatic message, that of a market repositioning for a reacceleration of the economy, following the playbook that's often cracked open in an early-cycle phase when the Federal Reserve is loosening policy. Last week against a flattish benchmark, the Dow Jones Transportation Average rose 3.6%, regional banks as a group added 2.7%, and the State Street SPDR Retail ETF gained 2.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 notched a new record close, which owes something to the lower-quality speculative names that sit among its largest components, but also rhymes with the notion of a pickup in growth coinciding with the Fed executing another rate cut next week. Cyclical sectors more broadly have held their advantage over defensive groups. Goldman Sachs strategists plotted this relationship alongside the Street consensus for real U.S. GDP growth. Both are heading in the preferred direction. Still, note the last time these lines gapped apart to a similar degree at the end of 2024, when the crowd insistently bet on ""growth-friendly policies"" of the new administration energizing the economy. This isn't to suggest that another growth shock on par with the tariff panic of early this year lies ahead. But it's a reminder that the market lacks perfect clairvoyance about the economic future even a few months hence. No brokerage sees a down year Brokerage-house strategists, for their part, are singing along with the market's upbeat tune as they handicap what's to come in 2026. More than a dozen firms have published their outlooks, and I've read most of them. The average S & P 500 target is around 7600, up almost 11% from here. That's not a gaudy return, but is a bit elevated for the year-ahead average, and no firm sees a flat or down year. There is general agreement in blessing the consensus S & P 500 earnings-growth forecast of 14%, the assumption that profit margins will stay high and the belief that the index can hold most of its valuation (now at 22.5-times forward 12-month profits). A boost to individual tax refunds in the first quarter is at the very top of strategists' talking points, probably overstating the lasting impact. The administration has no doubt aligned fiscal policy to run the economy hotter in 2026, and Wall Street is broadly plugging in this scenario. The consensus expectations above are surely plausible. As I always say, investment strategy is the art of the plausible as much as politics are the art of the possible. Yet it's rare for a year to follow even a believable script written by committee. Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian is more cautious on S & P 500-level returns next year, looking for a modest lift to 7100, and for ""earnings to grow in the mid-double digits but multiples to compress by 5-10%."" She sees the AI-buildout story growing choppier, with lower returns on capital, as the money-flow backdrop grows less generous: ""Liquidity is full blast today, but the direction of travel is likely less not more - less buybacks, more capex, less central bank cuts than last year and a Fed cutting only if growth is weak."" An equity market that ""broadens"" as capital migrates toward older-economy areas – something so many professional investors wish to see — is not necessarily one that would flatter the headline indexes. And it's again become important to track each tick in longer-term bond yields, which could respond to the same ""reflationary"" dynamics the equity market is sniffing out by lifting yields far enough to counteract them. Treasuries have been quite benign toward stocks for months, hovering in a moderate range. Still, the 10-year note yield hasn't been able to hold under 4% and last week ticked higher to 4.14%. Not a threatening level yet, but also not far from breaking above an 11-month downtrend line. US10Y YTD mountain 10-year Treasury yield, YTD The starting point for fresh-money buying today's stock market is rather demanding, by some measures. Fidelity's head of global macro Jurrien Timmer calculates a version of the stock-bond valuation model using an implied equity risk premium. It uses current valuation and Treasury yields along with an assumption of 6%-7% long-term earnings growth to derive forward return prospects. From current levels, he says, ""the forward 5-year [compound annual growth rate] has always been less than the market's long-term CAGR of 10%. Furthermore, half the time it didn't even exceed the 3% inflation rate. That's not to say the market will be down over the next 5 years, just that it may well be below average."" Then again, this market has for years defied valuation-based mean-reversion arguments. The S & P 500 five years ago was above 23-times forward earnings – higher than nearly every reading since 2000 – and since then it has compounded at nearly a 15% annual rate of return. Don't fight the Fed? With the index quickly recovering from its 5% pullback and with short-term rates due to be trimmed further in a few days, the rule that says ""Don't fight the Fed and don't fight the tape"" is still favoring the upside case. And, for sure, there seems no real edge in betting against the late-December upside bias, even if last year he market skidded to the finish line. Further insulating the bull case: Most bull markets that last three years, as this one has, survive a fourth. The S & P 500's near-17% year-to-date price gain looks perfectly in line with one ought to have expected if told that non-U.S. stocks would be up 28% and the Fed is on the way to completing 175 basis points of rate cuts in 15 months with no recession in view and financial conditions lax. Besides, the S & P 500's near-20% mini-crash last spring, which came two-and-a-half years after a 20%, nine-month bear market, means we aren't ""due,"" in any important respect, for a wrenching payback phase. For now, too, the tape has encouragingly loosened its linkage to crypto prices, which remain close to recent lows even as the equity indexes have largely reclaimed their losses. In other words, not a lot to complain about with 17 trading days left in the year, though plenty to ponder during a quiet moment.",['Michael Santoli']

Michael Ochs Archives | Moviepix | Getty Images

In the dwindling days of the California gold rush, the wife of a local miner faced a problem. Her husband's denim work pants kept ripping, so her tailor, Jacob Davis, had the idea to add copper rivets to key points of strain, like the pocket corners and the base of the button fly, to keep them from tearing. Davis' ""riveted pants"" soon became a roaring success and, unbeknownst to him at the time, marked the official birth of the blue jean, a garment that would transform fashion and come to represent the United States around the globe. ""It really has democratized American fashion and it also is the greatest export that we have sent to the world, because people identify jeans specifically with American Western culture,"" said Shawn Grain Carter, a fashion professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. ""It doesn't matter your economic or social class. It doesn't matter what your views are in terms of the political spectrum. Everybody wears denim.""

These days, denim is a major sales driver for retailers big and small, as the global denim market reached $101 billion this year, up 28% from 2020, according to data from market research company Euromonitor International. Major apparel companies from American Eagle to Levi Strauss are in a race to corner that market, leaning on A-list celebrities like Sydney Sweeney and Beyonce to win over shoppers and drive sales in an unsteady economy. But if it weren't for Levi Strauss, founder of the eponymous blue jeans company, Davis' invention may not have gone far beyond the railroad town where it was created in the early 1870s.

How Levi's created blue jeans

Soon after Davis created his riveted pants, called ""waist overalls"" or ""overalls"" at the time, they began selling like ""hot cakes"" and he needed a business partner to secure a patent, said Tracey Panek, Levi's in-house historian. So he wrote to Strauss, a Bavarian-born immigrant who was running a successful wholesale business in San Francisco and had supplied Davis the denim he used to create his riveted pants. ""The secret of them Pents is the Rivits that I put in those Pockets and I found the demand so large that I cannot make them up fast enough,"" Davis wrote Strauss in a letter, according to PBS.

Levi Strauss Courtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.

Strauss, an ""astute"" businessman, recognized the opportunity and agreed to partner with Davis, said Panek. ""This would have been the first time that Levi was actually"" manufacturing his own products, said Panek. ""He was no longer just importing and selling other people's goods. He was manufacturing himself and selling to retailers."" On May 20, 1873, the two men secured a patent for the riveted pants and eventually opened a factory on Fremont Street, close to the modern-day Salesforce tower in San Francisco's financial district. They promised to offer workers the most durable jeans on the market and soon, business was booming.

Dude ranch duds and the American worker

Through Strauss' connections as a wholesaler, the company's riveted overalls soon spread across the U.S., becoming the garment of choice for working men everywhere: miners, cowboys, farmers – any role that required durable clothing. Jeans were exclusively reserved for work settings at the time, but as emerging denim manufacturers vied for a similar customer base, they looked to expand their assortment to drive sales. ""Slowly and steadily into the 20th century, you start to see some of these manufacturers making variations,"" said Sonya Abrego, a New York City-based fashion historian. ""There was this one design called spring bottom pants that was kind of a more form fitted, a more dressed up, a slightly flared, maybe what the factory foreman would be wearing, right? As opposed to just the guy on the shop floor."" In 1934, Levi created the first ever line of jeans for women. Around that time, denim started to become more popular in settings outside of work, primarily for activities like dude ranch vacations, camping and horseback riding. ""So they were kind of taking on a cowboy's garment or a worker's garment but wearing it in a … resort setting,"" said Abrego.

Dude ranch vacations had become popular because there were finally highways connecting different parts of the country, and few were willing to venture to Europe during a war. Companies like Levi began releasing advertisements highlighting their denim as ""dude ranch duds"" and ""authentic western riding wear"" to capture shoppers looking for jeans to bring with them on vacation, according to archival advertisements from the time. These cultural moments helped to expand denim beyond workers, but jeans didn't become widespread casual attire until after World War II, when American fashion overall started to shift.

The rise of the backyard BBQ

By the time World War II ended, the mighty American consumer was beginning to emerge. For years, Americans had been forced to ration common goods like rubber, sugar and meat while simultaneously being encouraged to save their money by buying war bonds and socking away spare cash. When the country shifted from wartime to peacetime, Americans were ready to splurge and soon began spending big on new cars, appliances and clothes. ""With a little bit more money to spend, you start seeing a bigger push for leisure clothes and fun clothes and play clothes, clothes to wear to backyard barbecues,"" said Abrego. ""Clothes that we would consider today as just like casual style.""

SpaceX is also telling some investors it will consider going public possibly around the end of next year, the report said.

At the elevated price, Musk's aerospace and defense contractor would be valued above ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which wrapped up a share sale at a $500 billion valuation in October.

SpaceX has been investing heavily in reusable rockets, launch facilities and satellites, while competing for government contracts with newer space players, including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. SpaceX is far ahead, and operates the world's largest network of satellites in low earth orbit through Starlink, which powers satellite internet services under the same brand name.

A SpaceX IPO would include its Starlink business, which the company previously considered spinning out.

Musk recently discussed whether SpaceX would go public during Tesla 's annual shareholders meeting last month. Musk, who is the CEO of both companies, said he doesn't love running publicly traded businesses, in part because they draw ""spurious lawsuits,"" and can ""make it very difficult to operate effectively.""

However, Musk said during the meeting that he wanted to ""try to figure out some way for Tesla shareholders to participate in SpaceX,"" adding, ""maybe at some point, SpaceX should become a public company despite all the downsides.""

2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Judge finalizes remedies in Google antitrust case,"The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 17, 2021.

A U.S. judge on Friday added new details to the remedies resulting from Google's antitrust case, finalizing the consequences the company faces after its defeat last year.

In mid-2024, Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search, and in September of this year, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Department of Justice, including a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser.

Google was, however, ordered to loosen its hold on search data.

Mehta on Friday issued additional details for his ruling.

""The age-old saying 'the devil is in the details' may not have been devised with the drafting of an antitrust remedies judgment in mind, but it sure does fit,"" Mehta wrote in one of the Friday filings.

Mehta wrote that Google can't enter into any deal like the one it's had with Apple ""unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered."" Google pays billions of dollars per year to Apple to be the default search engine on the Safari browser on iPhones, Macs and iPads.

The judge's ruling includes deals involving generative artificial intelligence products, and any ""application, software, service, feature, tool, functionality, or product"" that involve or use genAI or large language models.

GenAI ""plays a significant role in these remedies,"" Mehta wrote.

Mehta on Friday also included requirements on the makeup of a technical committee that will determine with whom Google must share its data. Committee ""members shall be experts in some combination of software engineering, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, economics, behavioral science, and data privacy and data security,"" the filing says.

The judge went on to say that no committee member can have a conflict of interest, such as having worked for Google or any of its competitors in the six months prior to or one year after serving in the role.

Mehta said the committee must ""have access to Google's source code and algorithms, subject to a confidentiality agreement,"" and reiterated the web index data it will require Google to share with certain competitors.

Google has to share some of the raw search interaction data it uses to train its ranking and AI systems, but not the actual algorithms. In September, Mehta said those data sets represent a ""small fraction"" of Google's overall traffic, but argued the company's models are trained on data that contributed to Google's edge over competitors.

In August 2024, Mehta ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act and held a monopoly in search and related advertising. The antitrust trial started in September 2023.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has previously said it will appeal the judge's monopoly ruling.

2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Wall Street turns to the Fed next week for more clues on the path ahead,"All eyes are on the Federal Reserve's final meeting of 2025 to see if the central bank will deliver the interest rate cut the market expects and, especially, what chair Jerome Powell says afterward about the outlook for monetary policy. After recent economic data revealed that inflation hasn't reignited and the labor market is showing signs of weakness, traders are confident the Fed will lower its key overnight lending rate a quarter percentage point. Interest rate futures trading suggests close to a 90% certainty the Fed policy rate will come down next week, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool . Trust in another rate cut — it would mark the Fed's third this year and bring the federal funds rate to 3.50%-3.75% – helped send the stock market higher this week. All three major averages scored weekly gains, led by 0.9% for the Nasdaq Composite . ""My very strong suspicion is that the Fed will cut next week,"" Scott Welch, chief investment officer at Certuity, told CNBC. ""The market will react very negatively if they don't."" In the price With the outlook for lower rates next week already reflected in current stock prices, the move itself won't act as a catalyst to push prices higher, Welch said. ""What will be more important is what Chairman Powell has to say afterward"" about the possible path of interest rates in 2026."" The market could respond positively if Powell signals a more dovish outlook for 2026, possibly paving the way for still easier money next year to arrest any slowdown in the jobs market. But Powell could also sound hawkish next week and dampen expectations for further rate cuts. ""If he comes out and says, 'Yeah, we decided to cut but don't count on [more] going forward,' I think the market may have a response to that,"" Welch continued. Powell's term as Fed chair ends in May 2026. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that there's "" a very good chance "" that President Donald Trump will make an announcement on the next chair ""before Christmas."" Lately, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has been seen as the favorite to replace Powell. ""Powell's term is almost up here. I think the market's more so focused on, 'Well, who's coming next, and is that person really going to be leading the charge downward even more so in rates somewhat, regardless of what the data says?'"" said David Krakauer, vice president of portfolio management at Mercer Advisors. ""The market has basically already priced in 100% that there's going to be a rate cut next week. I think what you're seeing here is just more potential fuel for what the longer term trajectory will be under more dovish leadership.""

2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Amazon had a very big week that could shape where its stagnant stock goes next,"Amazon made plenty of news this week — from advances in the cloud business to questions about its partnership with the U.S. Postal Service — leaving investors with a lot to digest. The flurry of headlines comes at the end of a challenging year. The e-commerce and cloud giant's stock is up 4.6%, compared to the broad market S & P 500's 16.4%, and well behind all of its Magnificent Seven peers. Despite the company showing reaccelerating growth in AWS and enhancements to its dominant Prime e-commerce ecosystem, investors remain concerned that it is losing ground in the AI race and could face margin pressure from tariffs. We believe the company has turned a corner. ""A better year is ahead as management continues to prove out its AI strategy and expand operating margins,"" Jeff Marks, portfolio director for Club, wrote in a report on Thursday, highlighting stocks that are set up for a bounce back in 2026. Here's how this week's news fits into that investment thesis: Upbeat updates at cloud event News: During Amazon 's annual re:Invent 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman unveiled Trainium3 , the latest version of the company's in-house custom chip. It delivers four times the compute performance, energy efficiency, and memory bandwidth of previous generations. AWS also announced that it is already working on Trainium4. The company also revealed a series of cloud products, including advanced AI-driven platforms and agents that help customers automate workloads. Our take: We were pleased to hear that AWS continues to innovate its chip offerings to diversify its reliance on Nvidia , the industry leader in graphics processing units (GPUs). However, most of the investor focus is on bringing data center capacity online. Amazon needs to buy more Nvidia chips to catch up in AI. Also, Jim Cramer interviewed AWS CEO Matt Garman on ""Mad Money"" earlier this week, who was upbeat about the future growth of the cloud business. USPS ties tested News: According to a Washington Post report, Amazon could sever its relationship with the USPS when its contract expires in October 2026. Amazon likely considered the move, as it already has a shadow postal service, Amazon Logistics, that handles billions of packages annually. By removing USPS as the middleman, Amazon would have complete financial and operational control. Amazon refuted the report . Our take: For years, the e-commerce and cloud giant invested billions of dollars to build a vast logistics network that is now delivering more packages in the U.S. than UPS and FedEx . It still uses the USPS for delivery of small, low-weight packages, especially those from third-party Amazon sellers. USPS is also helpful for ""last-mile delivery"" in difficult-to-serve geographic areas. If the company were to eliminate the Postal Service as a middleman, it could further reduce its cost to serve, thereby improving margins. Possible IPO payday News: Anthropic, the AI startup behind the Claude chatbot, is reportedly in talks to launch one of the biggest IPOs ever in early 2026, according to the Financial Times. Anthropic responded that it had no immediate plans for an IPO and instead is ""keeping our options open,"" Anthropic chief communications officer Sasha de Marigny said at an Axios event in New York City on Thursday. Our take: An Anthropic public offering could be a massive payday for Amazon, which has invested about $8 billion in Anthropic. As part of that investment, Anthropic partnered with AWS as its primary cloud provider and training partner to run its massive AI training and inference workloads. An Anthropic IPO would elevate the AI startup and thereby enhance AWS's dominance as the best-in-class cloud provider. Ultra-fast grocery delivery News: Amazon said it is testing an ultra-fast delivery service for fresh groceries, everyday essentials, and popular items, available in as little as 30 minutes, starting in Seattle and Philadelphia. Amazon Prime members get discounted delivery fees starting at $3.99 per order, compared with $13.99 for non-Prime customers. Club take: Amazon has continued to expand into online grocery and essentials, as customers increasingly opt to shop for daily essentials with the online retailer. While the retail business comes with thin margins, Amazon continues to operate it with an eye on reducing its cost to serve, which should help improve margins over time. Amazon is already second in line as the top U.S. retailer, right behind Walmart in terms of U.S. online grocery sales. As it continues to make headway in the industry, Amazon should be able to capitalize on this significant growth opportunity, especially as it harnesses its advanced AI capabilities for optimal inventory placement and demand forecasting.

Market update : Stocks are slightly higher Friday and on pace for a small weekly gain. It's been two full weeks since New York Fed President John Williams gave new life to the possibility of an interest rate cut at the December Fed meeting, and since then, the market has rebounded by 5%. Banks and other economically sensitive stocks are up on the strong likelihood of a cut next week. Capital One , Goldman Sachs , and Wells Fargo all hit new highs on Friday. However, we remain aware of overbought market conditions, as indicated by the S & P Oscillator reaching 4.6% on Thursday. Anything above a plus 4% would suggest the market is overbought; anything below a minus 4% would indicate the market is oversold. The next reading comes out after the market closes. Corning's growing importance : SoftBank CEO Masa Son is working on a plan to create Trump-branded industrial parks, The Wall Street Journal reported late Thursday. According to the report, the starry-eyed CEO wants to build factories to produce fiber-optic cable, data center equipment, and other critical components for AI infrastructure, funded by Japan. One digital news publisher said shares of Corning , the industry leader in fiber-optic cable, turned negative because of this story, suggesting competition is coming. However, we wouldn't read too much into this report just yet, and Corning shares are up in the session. Our initial reaction to Son's dream is that it could take years to fulfill, if it even becomes a reality. Perhaps more importantly, Son's desire to build fiber-optic manufacturing sites highlights Corning's growing importance in the data center ecosystem, especially in modern data centers that prefer fiber-optic cabling over copper to link GPU clusters because it is more economical. Next week: The calendar is winding down, but there are still a bunch of huge events. GE Vernova will host an investor day, and several notable earnings reports are scheduled, including Broadcom , Costco , Toll Brothers , Campbell's , AeroVironment , Cracker Barrel , Chewy , Vail Resorts , Synopsys , Ciena , and Lululemon . There's also the Fed Meeting on Wednesday, and odds are that the committee will cut interest rates by 25 basis points. In addition, the Fed will update its Summary of Economic Projections, which could provide clues about how many rate cuts the committee anticipates next year. We'll wrap things up with our December Monthly Investing Club meeting on Friday at noon ET. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

The Supreme Court on Friday said it will hear arguments in a case that will determine if President Donald Trump can undo automatic citizenship for people born in the United States.

Trump, on his first day back in the White House on Jan. 20, issued an executive order that said babies born in the U.S. more than 30 days after that order were not entitled to be issued citizenship documents if their parents were temporary visitors or illegal immigrants.

Before Trump's order, there was little dispute that the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment, with rare exceptions, meant that children born in the country were automatically U.S. citizens, regardless of their parents' status.

The Citizenship Clause in that amendment says, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.""

The Supreme Court, which is expected to rule next year, will determine if Trump's executive order complies with that amendment.

The order told federal agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of children born in the U.S. if their mother ""was unlawfully present in the United States and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth,"" or when the baby's ""mother's presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time.""

Several federal district court judges have found that Trump's order violated the Constitution, and two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from taking effect.",['Dan Mangan']

The stock climbed 13% over the past five days, its best weekly performance since December 2023.

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.25, topping Wall Street's estimates of $2.86 per share. Revenue increased 8.6% year over year to $10.26 billion but just missed analyst projections of $10.27 billion.

Although the artificial intelligence boom has pushed several tech companies into record surges, cloud software firms have seen a rocky year as investors wonder whether AI will render the industry obsolete.

Salesforce is hoping to persuade Wall Street that AI will be able to bolster its products rather than replace them.

Investors ""somehow think software companies are under arrest from AI, when the opposite is true,"" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday.

During the third quarter, the company acquired startups Regrello and Waii, which uses AI to generate code with natural language instructions.

Despite Salesforce's shares being down 22% year to date, compared with the Nasdaq's 22% gain, analysts are more optimistic for 2026.

""CRM [Salesforce] continues to be levered to digital transformation, and we expect the company to grow at a solid rate going forward,"" Mizuho analysts wrote. ""At the same time, we believe CRM will remain fiscally disciplined and that it can continue to drive higher operating and FCF margins.""

Analysts highlighted Salesforce's AI platform Agentforce, which builds agents that automate business tasks and streamline workflow.

Despite initial investor skepticism over the platform, Cantor analysts were encouraged by its strong adoption in the customer service space.

""We think CRM is starting to formalize and mature the strategy, which should make it easier for customers to understand, and therefore adopt, Agentforce,"" the Cantor analysts wrote.

Annual recurring revenue of Agentforce jumped 330% year over year to $540 million.

""Why everyone is so excited about Agentforce is because this is what AI was meant to be,"" Benioff said. ""It brings together humans and data and AI and apps, and delivers an incredible experience for companies.""

This isn't exactly what David Ellison had planned in September. Just a few months ago, the Paramount Skydance CEO sent a letter to the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors arguing a combination of the two media and entertainment companies made sense. That letter was the first of several that offered increasingly higher prices to acquire the company along with arguments of why the assets were better together. Paramount's interest spurred a formal sale process — bringing Comcast and Netflix into the mix — which ultimately doubled the value of Warner Bros. Discovery shares and culminated, at least for the moment, in Paramount losing out in the bidding war it started. On Friday, Netflix announced a deal to acquire HBO Max and the famed Warner Bros. film studio for $27.75 per share, or an equity value of $72 billion. WBD will move forward with a plan to separate out its pay-TV networks, such as CNN and TNT Sports, before the deal closes. Instead of supercharging Paramount, just months after gaining control of the company through a merger with Skydance, Ellison effectively handed a prized jewel of the media and entertainment industry to its most dominant player, strengthening Netflix's reach and stripping Paramount and Comcast's NBCUniversal of an obvious merger target. ""It wasn't for sale before, and they certainly hadn't cleaned up the assets or separated the assets in the way they have right now,"" said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in a conference call Friday morning after announcing the deal. ""I think that kind of goes to the 'why now.'"" Ellison jump-started a process that has made a lot of money for Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, WBD's executive team and its shareholders.

Zaslav's share

Zaslav currently owns more than 4.2 million shares of Warner Bros. Discovery, with another 6.2 million shares that would be delivered to him in the future via previously granted stock awards, according to Equilar. Zaslav also has a grant of almost 20.9 million options with an exercise price of $10.16, Equilar found. Based on the Netflix-WBD transaction price of $27.75 per share, all of that adds up to more than $554 million for the WBD CEO. Factoring in another 4 million shares that Zaslav is set to receive in January, according to a person close to the situation who declined to be named speaking about the executive's holdings, the true total is closer to $660 million. For shareholders, the sale process has brought a similar windfall. Warner Bros. Discovery stock closed at $12.54 on Sept. 10, the day before The Wall Street Journal reported Paramount was preparing a bid for the company. On Friday morning, Warner Bros. Discovery shares were up almost 3% to more than $25 apiece. That's more than double Warner Bros. Discovery's unaffected sale process price and a return to 2022 levels when WarnerMedia and Discovery first merged. That's vindication for Zaslav, who has spent nearly four years coming under fire from Hollywood and investors for failing to deliver for shareholders. With Friday's announcement, he's effectively pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. And still, Paramount is likely not done with its pursuit of buying all of Warner Bros. Discovery.

Dirk Willer, the bank's global head of macro strategy and asset allocation, said recent choppiness in the AI trade doesn't mean the bubble is ending. As a result, investors should stay in the stocks, he said. ""While the U.S. equity market has triggered our definition of a bubble, which creates some risks, it is important to stress that bubbles are at first typically quite profitable,"" Willer wrote to clients in a note on Thursday. ""We therefore would not overstress the recent AI wobbles, as they are unlikely to herald the end of the bubble.""

The bubble peak can be estimated by looking at liquidity and technical analysis — which he said can provide earlier warning signals than the profit outlook.

The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.5% in November, snapping a seven-month advance.

Movie theater operators woke up Friday to the possibility of a new world order. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced a deal for the streaming giant to acquire WBD's film studio and streaming service, bringing an end to a months-long bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the assets. With Netflix as the victor, exhibitors are in a panic. Unlike traditional movie studios, the streamer has not adhered to conventional theatrical distribution, and there are fears that big changes could be coming to an industry that is still struggling post-pandemic. ""It's no secret that this was probably the least desired outcome for many theater owners,"" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. ""There are no two ways around that. This may be one of the most meaningful days in the history of the business, but it could yet be a constructive one for cinema if Netflix honors early indications that it will maintain the theatrical business model of Warner Bros. properties and lean into those unique strengths which are not replicable on the streaming platform."" Cinema United, the world's largest exhibition trade association, came out strong Friday morning against the sale of WBD assets to Netflix. ""The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business,"" CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement. ""The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world."" A half dozen movie theater operators who spoke to CNBC shared concerns that Netflix's acquisition of WBD would lead to a significant decline in the number of films made available to cinemas annually and, therefore, hit annual box office ticket sales. ""Netflix's stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite,"" O'Leary said. Cinema United said the deal ""would risk removing 25% of the annual domestic box office"" putting smaller theater chains and independent cinemas, in particular, at risk.

""We are going to be pulling all of the levers we can because we think that a deal of this magnitude and the potential impact that it will have is something that everyone with regulatory and oversight authority needs to look closely at,"" O'Leary said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" Friday. ""So, we've already been talking to people at the federal level, at the state level and internationally because this is a significant, significant threat, we believe, to the long-term viability of the theatrical exhibition."" And Cinema United isn't the only group worried about the future of the industry if the Netflix deal is approved. A collective of top industry players sent an open letter to Congress detailing the potential economic and institutional blowback that could play out if the merger goes through. The letter, reported by Variety, stated that Netflix would ""effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace"" and could alter the footprint of theatrical movies and decrease licensing fees paid in post-theatrical windows.

Donald Trump","U.S. President Donald Trump receives the FIFA Peace Prize from FIFA President during the draw for the 2026 FIFA Football World Cup taking place in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, DC, on December 5, 2025.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not attending the draw for the 2026 World Cup to receive a prize, but he got one anyway.

Trump, who has campaigned aggressively this year for a Nobel Peace Prize, was given FIFA's inaugural peace prize for his efforts to promote dialogue and de-escalation in some of the world's biggest hotspots.

The former TV reality show host dominated the scene at Washington's Kennedy Center on Friday, placing himself squarely at the center of one of the biggest events in the sporting world in a glitzy, celebrity-studded affair that bore the unmistakable stamp of the president.

The United States, along with Canada and Mexico, will host the soccer tournament next year. The prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, and the president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, were there, too, but it was Trump's show from start to finish.

In a nod to Trump's love of spectacle, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who served as master of ceremonies, had the three leaders stand behind brightly colored podiums - game-show style - to draw their teams. After the draw, they all posed for a selfie with Infantino.

""This will be unique, this will be stellar, this will be spectacular,"" Infantino said at the outset of the ceremony, referring to next year's games. But he could also have been talking about the Kennedy Center event itself, which was located in Washington at Trump's urging.

Last month, FIFA announced that a new annual award called the FIFA Peace Prize would be presented at the draw to ""reward individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace.""

A video prior to the presentation celebrated Trump for resolving the war in Gaza and trying to end Russia's war in Ukraine. The trophy, a gold-plated globe carried by upraised hands, was considerably larger than the Nobel, which is just a simple medal. Trump was given a medal as well and donned it as Infantino lauded him. The president deserved the award for ""promoting peace and unity around the world,"" he said.

""This is truly one of the great honors of my life – and beyond,"" Trump said. He took a moment to congratulate himself. The United States, he said, was ""not doing too well"" before he took office, but now ""we're the hottest country anywhere in the world.""

Earlier, Trump told reporters he did not care about the prize, but noted that he had ""settled eight wars"" in his 10 months in office.

""I don't need prizes. I need to save lives,"" Trump said. ""I saved millions and millions of lives, and that's really what I want to do.""",[]

The firm develops AI chips for self-driving cars. Goldman analysts said its stock would be worth 15.30 Hong Kong dollars ($1.97) in the next 12 months due to competitor analysis and operating profit growth. Key downside risks include stronger-than-anticipated competition or pricing pressure in the auto supply chain pricing pressure, which Goldman said may come from slowing demand. The company's performance could be affected if it doesn't upgrade its product base or attract enough new customers, the note stated. It added that geopolitical tensions present supply chain risks. Horizon Robotics' share price has risen 130% year-to-date. Goldman is watching for the mass production of its J6P chip and driving assistance software HSD. Taiwanese tech firm Hon Hai Goldman tips Taiwanese technology firm Hon Hai for accelerated growth due to artificial intelligence servers and smartphones. The company's products include consumer electronics and cloud services. It sees a potential upside of 77% and rates the stock buy. Goldman said Hon Hai should be valued at 21-times earnings, based on competitor analysis, giving it a 12-month price target of 400 New Taiwan Dollars. Weaker-than-expected performance in its AI servers business and electric vehicle services poses risks to the company's performance, Goldman said, as does a slower ramp-up of global capacity and ""fiercer-than-expected"" competition in manufacturing consumer electronics. The technology firm's stock price is up over 24% year-to-date. Hon Hai's 2025 earnings are expected in March. German online retailer Zalando Goldman improved its outlook for online retailer Zalando . In November's list , it gave the German company an upside of 77%. In December, analysts expect an upside as high as 90%, calling Zalando an ""online channel shift winner with underappreciated upside from About You acquisition."" The About You deal was completed earlier this year. Zalando delivered strong third-quarter results in November, after the stock fell 4.4% in October. Goldman attributed the fall to investor concerns over consumer cautiousness in Europe and potential disruption from AI. Goldman's managing director Richard Edwards ""continues to believe the market under-appreciates Zalando's ability to drive both topline performance"" and earnings before interest and taxes margin expansion, and ""thinks that its current valuation is too low"" for a business which should grow earnings 20% each year for the next five years, the note said. Zalando's share price has fallen 26% year-to-date. India-based travel company MakeMyTrip India-founded online travel company MakeMyTrip has ""catalysts in place for growth recovery,"" Goldman said, giving it an expected upside of 72%. The investment bank has a buy rating on the name, which has a 12-month price target of $123 due to future cash flows, earnings multiples and possible M & A value. But ""key risks to our investment view include weaker-than-expected travel demand, higher competition, pressure on take rates and sub-optimal capital allocation,"" the note said. Shares in MakeMyTrip, which is listed in the U.S., have moved 37% lower year-to-date. Investors will be watching the firm's third-quarter earnings for the 2026 fiscal year, expected in January. U.K. finance firm Wise British finance firm Wise is a ""long term cross border payments winner with best-in-class technology and infrastructure,"" according to Goldman, which gives a 70% upside.

2025-12-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,India warns IndiGo of regulatory action and takes action to cap airfare surge,"Passengers are seen amid heavy crowds and chaotic scenes at Indira Gandhi International Airport after stringent new crew-rostering rules triggered widespread delays and cancellations in New Delhi, India, on Dec. 5, 2025.

India's aviation watchdog on Saturday warned airline IndiGo of regulatory action after it canceled thousands of flights over the last week, stranding passengers and forcing government action to limit a surge in airfares caused by the crisis.

The country's biggest airline, IndiGo canceled the flights because of a shortage of pilots after it failed to plan adequately for new rules limiting how many hours they work.

The civil aviation watchdog sent the notice to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers, giving him 24 hours to respond and say why regulatory action - which can include penalties and suspension of officials - should not be taken against the airline.

As the CEO ""you have failed in your duty to ensure timely arrangements for conduct of reliable operations,"" said the notice, signed by Directorate General of Civil Aviation official, Ravinder Singh Jamwal.

The notice is confidential but was reviewed by Reuters. IndiGo did not respond to a request for comment on the warning.

Earlier in the day, India capped airfares, which have been driven higher by the increase in demand for flights operated by other carriers. IndiGo canceled another 385 flights on Saturday, the fifth day of the crisis.

The government on Friday announced exemptions from the new rules for the carrier and laid on additional trains to help clear the backlog.

Delhi airport posted on X on Saturday that flight operations were steadily resuming. Cancellations however continued at many airports.

The Civil Aviation Ministry said it would ""continue to closely monitor fare levels through real-time data and active coordination with airlines"".

Fares were last capped during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

The Indian government said a one-way fare for a journey up to 500 kilometers cannot be more than 7,500 rupees ($83), whereas for journeys between 1,000 and 1,500 km - such as the New Delhi-Mumbai route - should be capped at 15,000 rupees ($167).

That was well under the 20,419 rupee ($227) price advertised by Air India on its website for a Delhi-Mumbai flight on Saturday.

The flight cancellations are the biggest crisis in IndiGo's 20 years of operation. The airline has a more than 60% market share in the world's most-populous country and has prided itself on on-time performance and affordable fares.

IndiGo has said it failed to plan adequately for the November 1 deadline to implement the stricter rules on night flying and weekly rest for pilots. It only suffered a roster crisis this week as December is the peak time for holidays and weddings in India.

On Friday, more than 1,000 IndiGo flights were canceled. After the government announced the exemptions to the rules for IndiGo, the airline said it could return to normal operations between December 10 and 15.

On Saturday, IndiGo canceled 124 flights in Bengaluru, 109 in Mumbai, 86 in New Delhi and 66 in Hyderabad, airport sources told Reuters.

Hundreds of passengers gathered outside Bengaluru and Mumbai airports on Saturday, some unaware of the cancelations, according to Reuters witnesses.

Satish Konde had to catch a connecting flight from Mumbai to the western city of Nagpur and had checked in before being told it was canceled.

""I am waiting for my luggage to be returned,"" he said.

The new pilot rest and duty rules capped the number of night landings to two from six and restricted the maximum number of hours a pilot can fly in the night to 10 hours.

For now, IndiGo has been exempted from both measures until Feb. 10.

The new rules also said that if a pilot takes personal leave, that cannot be counted in calculating his weekly rest period of 48 hours. That restriction too has been put on hold for all airlines, given the IndiGo crisis.

That has upset pilot labour groups, who told the government that safety must not be compromised to make up for IndiGo's poor planning, the head of the Federation of Indian Pilots, C.S. Randhawa, told Reuters.

The Airline Pilots Association of India objected on Friday, calling the relief for IndiGo ""selective dispensation"". The norms ""exist solely to safeguard human life,"" the association said in a letter to the government.

Other major Indian airlines, including Air India and Akasa, have not had to cancel flights due to the new rules.",[]

A plant producing rare-earth magnets for Europe's electric vehicle and wind-energy sectors. Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images

NARVA, Estonia — Europe's big bet to break China's rare earths dominance starts on Russia's doorstep. The continent's largest rare-earth facility, situated on the very edge of NATO's eastern flank, is ramping up magnet production as part of a regional push to reduce its import reliance on Beijing. Developed by Canada's Neo Performance Materials and opened in mid-September, the magnet plant sits in the small industrial city of Narva. This little-known border city is separated from Russia by the Narva River, which is an external frontier of both NATO and the European Union. Analysts expect the facility to play an integral role in Europe's plan to reduce its dependence on China, while warning that the region faces a long and difficult road ahead if it is to achieve its mineral strategy goals. Magnets made from rare earths are essential components for the function of modern technology, such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, smartphones, medical equipment, artificial intelligence applications and precision weaponry. Speaking to CNBC by video call, Neo CEO Rahim Suleman said the facility is on track to produce 2,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets this year, before scaling up to 5,000 tons and beyond as it seeks to keep pace with ""an enormously quick-growing market.""

It is a frankly a billion-dollar problem that affects trillion-dollar downstream industries. So, it is worth solving. Ryan Castilloux managing director of Adamas Intelligence

The European region currently imports nearly all of its rare earth magnets from China, although Suleman expects Neo's Narva facility to be capable of fulfilling around 10% of that demand. ""Having said that, our view of that number is something like 20,000 tons. So, we'd have a lot more work to do, a lot more building to do because I think the customers have a real need to diversify their supply chains,"" Suleman said. ""We're not talking about independence from any jurisdiction. We're just talking about creating robust and diverse supply chains to reduce concentration risk,"" he added. Neo has previously announced initial contracts with Schaeffler and Bosch, major auto suppliers to the likes of German auto giants Volkswagen and BMW . Europe's push to deliver on its resource security goals faces several obstacles. Analysts have cited issues including a funding shortfall, burdensome regulation, a limited and fragmented made-in-EU supply chain and relatively high production costs. All of these raise questions about the viability of the EU's ambitious supply chain targets. ""Europe needs a big increase in rare earth magnet capacity to even come close to a diversified supply chain for its carmakers,"" Caroline Messecar, an analyst at Fastmarkets, told CNBC by email.

'The guillotine still looms'

Once a previously obscure issue, rare earths have come to the fore as a key bargaining chip in the ongoing geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China. In October, China agreed to delay the introduction of further export controls on rare earth minerals as part of a deal agreed between China's Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump. China's earlier rare earths restrictions, which upended global supply chains, remain in place, however. ""The threat is still there; the guillotine still looms. And so, I think collectively all of this has just sobered the West, end-users and governments to the risks that they face,"" Ryan Castilloux, managing director of critical mineral consultancy Adamas Intelligence, told CNBC by phone. ""It is a frankly a billion-dollar problem that affects trillion-dollar downstream industries. So, it is worth solving,"" he added.

In its Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, identified Chinese export controls leading to supply chain disruptions in several sectors such as autos and green energy. It thrusts the issue of supply diversification in the spotlight for European policymakers, especially as demand is projected to grow until 2030 and EU supply remains highly reliant on a single supplier, according to a statement from a European Commission spokesperson. In response, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced in October that plans were underway to launch a so-called ""RESourceEU"" plan — along the lines of its ""REPowerEU"" initiative, which sought to overcome another supply issue — energy. The Narva project predates these measures but, with 18.7 million euros ($21.7 million) in EU funding, it's an example of what the EU hopes to achieve. And although its output is modest when compared to overall demand, it demonstrates how the EU plans to boost the bloc's magnet output capacity and reduce dependence on Chinese supply.

China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, responsible for nearly 60% of the world's rare earths mining and more than 90% of magnet manufacturing. Europe, meanwhile, is the world's biggest export market for Chinese rare earths.

Russia's doorstep

The location of Neo's new magnet facility, meanwhile, has raised some eyebrows, given the potential security challenge of being in such close proximity to Russia. Speaking shortly after Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Narva was historically part of Russia and needed to be taken back.

Asked why the company positioned its new rare earths plant there, Neo's Suleman said the firm already had an existing infrastructure presence in the country, ""and the right place was to be in Europe."" ""And then you go one step deeper, which is to get into Estonia. We have a long history in Estonia. We already have a rare separation facility that can do both light rare earths, and we're developing heavy rare earths there,"" Suleman said. ""We've been extremely impressed by the quality of the people in Estonia, their education level, their commitment to hard work ... So, you put all that together, along with the support that we received both in Estonia and in the EU, and it was a great choice for us,"" he added. Estonian lawmakers have welcomed the potential of Neo's magnet plant, saying the facility will benefit the development of both the country and broader region. Jaanus Uiga, deputy secretary general for Energy and Mineral Resources of Estonia, said Neo's magnet plant opened ""very on time.""

2025-12-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Bitcoin is down nearly 30% from its record high — history shows that's normal,"Bitcoin 's more than 30% drop from its record high underscores the volatility that has come to characterize the cryptocurrency.

Moves from previous cycles not only show how the current price swings are all part of bitcoin's normal operating pattern but also how they may often precede a rally, according to figures compiled by CoinDesk Data for CNBC.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, dropped to a low of around $80,000 late last month before staging a rally and falling again this week. When bitcoin dropped to under $81,000, that represented an approximately 36% fall from its all-time high of around $126,000 hit earlier in October. As of Thursday, bitcoin was trading at over $93,000, according to Coinmetrics, a roughly 26% decline from its record high.

These price swings may seem large but they are normal in relation to bitcoin's history.

Bitcoin's price movement is often referred to in ""cycles."" Generally, the bitcoin cycle refers to a four-year pattern of price movement that revolves around a key event known as the halving, a change to mining rewards that is written in bitcoin's code. While there are signs that the typical timing and patterns of the cycles could be changing, the range of price movements appears to be consistent.

In the current cycle, bitcoin has already weathered a 32.7% pullback from March to August 2024 and a 31.7% decline between January and April 2025, according to CoinDesk Data.

""Looking at previous cycles, volatility of this magnitude appears consistent with long-term trends,"" Jacob Joseph, senior research analyst at CoinDesk Data, told CNBC.",['Arjun Kharpal']
2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Netflix to buy Warner Bros. film and streaming assets in $72 billion deal,"Netflix announced Friday it's reached a deal to buy pieces of Warner Bros. Discovery, bringing a swift end to a dramatic bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the legacy assets.

The transaction is comprised of cash and stock and is valued at $27.75 per WBD share, the companies said. That puts the equity value of the deal at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion.

Netflix will acquire Warner Bros.' film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. Warner Bros. Discovery will move forward with its previously planned spinout of Discovery Global, which includes its massive portfolio of pay TV networks, such as TNT and CNN.

The blockbuster deal brings together the streaming giant Netflix, which has upended the media industry in recent years, and the storied Warner Bros. film studio, known for its library including ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the Harry Potter franchise and the DC comics universe. It will also include the content of HBO Max, including ""The Sopranos"" and ""Game of Thrones.""

""I know some of you're surprised that we're making this acquisition, and I certainly understand why. Over the years, we have been known to be builders, not buyers,"" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on an investor call Friday morning.

""We already have incredible shows and movies and a great business model, and it's working for talent, it's working for consumers and it's working for shareholders. This is a rare opportunity,"" he said. ""It's going to help us achieve our mission to entertain the world and to bring people together through great stories.""

Netflix's initial bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets was for $27 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. That trumped Paramount's offer at the time and turned the trajectory of the sales talks in Netflix's direction, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.

The acquisition is expected to close after the TV networks separation takes place, now expected in the third quarter of 2026. The companies estimated the transaction would close in 12 to 18 months.

CNBC has reached out to Comcast and Paramount for comment.

As part of the deal, every Warner Bros. Discovery shareholder will receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock for each share of WBD common stock outstanding following the close of the deal.

Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery said each of their boards of directors unanimously approved the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval as well as approval of WBD shareholders.

Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion reverse break-up fee if the deal is not approved, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Warner Bros. Discovery would pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it decides to call off the deal to pursue a different merger.","['Lillian Rizzo Sara Salinas', 'Lillian Rizzo', 'Sara Salinas', 'In Saracsalinas']"
2025-12-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,CNBC Sport: U.S. men’s soccer is sick of losing the World Cup — and now it has a plan,"A version of this article first appeared in the CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman, which brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. Americans are great at sports. The United States has won more Olympic gold medals – by far – than any other country. The U.S. women's soccer national team has won four of nine FIFA World Cups all time. And yet, the U.S. men's national soccer team has never won a World Cup. The team's best finish was third place in 1930. In modern times, the U.S. men's team has never advanced past the quarterfinals. If you don't know already, the 2026 World Cup is coming to the U.S. (and Mexico and Canada). The draw for the World Cup will be held Friday in Washington, D.C., sorting 48 teams into groups. Those groups will play round-robin style to begin the tournament, which runs from June 11 to July 19. The World Cup final will take place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Yet again, the U.S. men's soccer team isn't expected to win – or even come close. Current odds on DraftKings peg the U.S. men's team at 80-1, behind Spain, England, France, Brazil, Argentina, Portugal, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Italy, Colombia, Belgium and Uruguay. Italy hasn't even qualified for the tournament yet and is only 30-1. The U.S. Soccer Federation hopes the spectacle of next year's event will be a catalyst to change the trajectory of men's soccer forever. The organization, which functions as the governing body of U.S. soccer and is responsible for both promoting the sport and supporting all levels of play, has developed a ""Pathway Strategy"" to compete – and actually win – World Cups to come. The strategy has three prongs: reduce the financial barriers that limit youth participation in the sport, establish soccer as the most-played sport in the U.S., and then, finally, develop men's and women's national teams capable of winning World Cups every four years. ""In the women's game, we have more great players in America than any other country in the world. We probably could field a whole number of World Cup squads,"" said JT Batson , CEO of the U.S. Soccer Federation, in an interview. ""On the men's side … the opportunity is to really focus on those top players at the ages 13 to 17 and 18 to 23 and to put them in the right environments, whether it's the right professional clubs, whether it's the right academy programs, or whether the right youth national team program to make sure that best against best happens more often, and that we're putting those players in a position to to be world class."" Title IX, passed in 1972, gave college-aged women a leg up over many other countries in terms of opportunities to play high level soccer, explained Cindy Parlow Cone , the president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, who works in tandem with Batson to lead the official governing body of soccer in the United States. That's allowed the women's teams to develop elite players relative to the rest of the world. ""There was programming at a pretty high level on the girls and women's side, both at the college level and within U.S. Soccer, which I think propelled the women's team to the championships that we've seen,"" Parlow Cone said. Batson explained to me that while the U.S. benefits from having a population of nearly 350 million people, it is cursed with a lot of land, making it more difficult for the country's best players to play against each other and train together. ""Think about a country like England. You can get in a car and drive to St. George's Park, which is their national training center, or a bus, which massively lowers the cost and lowers the friction for the best players to play against the best players,"" Batson said. ""One of the challenges we have in our sort of physical scale is, how do you bring people together on a frequent enough basis to where the best can play against the best?"" Of course, countries like Argentina and Brazil have a lot of land, too, and those nations win World Cups. That's where building ""soccer culture"" in the U.S. comes into play, Batson said. Batson hopes the World Cup will act as a ""forcing function"" to grow the game among kids and increase investment at the highest levels. He noted the Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center in Georgia will provide a state-of-the-art complex for the 27 U.S. national teams (across age group, sport variant, disability and gender), putting them all under one roof for the first time. ""We would not have [that facility] without the World Cup coming here,"" said Batson. Participation in the game will increase ""at every level"" because of the World Cup, Parlow Cone predicted. The U.S. has a unique window to capitalize on developing household-name stars with the 2026 World Cup, followed by the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 2031 Women's World Cup, which is also set to take place in the U.S. There are tens of millions of American soccer fans, though attention is fragmented between international leagues, and fans of women's soccer don't always bleed into the men's game, Batson noted. About 130 million Americans were ""engaged"" with the last World Cup, and between 35 million and 40 million Americans are ""really hardcore soccer fans,"" he said. Batson hopes the World Cup will jumpstart the business of soccer, which he says is essential to developing a national team that can compete for a championship. ""If we're going to achieve what we want to go achieve, it's going to take resourcing,"" said Batson. ""We've got to grow our media rights, we've got to grow our commercial partners. We've got to grow ticket sales. And a big part of the success of U.S. Soccer has been our philanthropic growth. People who've really stepped up to allow us to invest ahead of where the business market is."" On the record With Parlow Cone and Michele Kang ... One of those investors is Michele Kang , who spoke to me along with Batson and Parlow Cone at this week's 2025 U.S. Soccer Summit in New York. Kang is the owner of the NWSL's Washington Spirit, which has reached the league championship game four times in the past 10 years, winning in 2021 and losing in the finals last season and this year. She's also a billionaire, originally from South Korea, who has committed $55 million to establish the Kang Women's Institute and fund youth soccer development. The Kang Women's Institute will study and provide research to properly train female athletes. Most of the science behind training athletes has been geared toward men, Kang told me. ""We're training our female players as if they're small men,"" she said. ""Not much research money is going into women's athletics."" Kang hopes the institute acts like a ""small match"" that ""lights a fire"" for others to invest in training research for women. The Spirit also happens to be the team for which Trinity Rodman plays. Rodman is one of the NWSL's biggest stars and the daughter of former NBA superstar Dennis Rodman . But she's considering leaving the league for Europe – much to Kang's chagrin. ""We have probably the best, if not one of the best, fans. And you just step into the stadium, and actually our players have to wear earplugs because they're so loud, so enthusiastic,"" Kang said. ""It's going to be very hard to replicate that kind of environment. So we're trying to convince her that this is her home, and we're doing everything we can to keep her in Washington, D.C."" Still, Kang also admitted going abroad has its perks. She already owns teams in Europe and is looking to acquire teams in both South America and Africa, she told me. ""If I were a player, if I had played in NWSL for five, six, seven, eight, years, I'd want to go try something new. I'd want to try some different environment,"" Kang said. Rodman has played in the NWSL since 2021. You can watch that entire conversation here . Or listen here and follow the CNBC Sport podcast if you prefer the audio version. Contessa's Corner Kalshi this week announced a new billion-dollar funding round, more than doubling its valuation from $5 billion to $11 billion since its last round in early October. It added new investors Ark Invest and Meritech Capital. Kalshi told me it's looking to grow its direct-to-consumer business. There are questions about whether its partnership with Robinhood will end now that Robinhood has acquired its own derivatives exchange, MIAXdx. But I'm told the current valuation didn't factor in the Robinhood tie-up. That eye-popping growth helps explain why seemingly everyone wants in on the predictions market. Fanatics launched its own prediction platform this week. ""This is really the top of the first inning on some market that's going to grow exponentially over the next five to ten years,"" Matt King , the CEO of Fanatics Betting and Gaming, told us on ""Squawk on the Street."" The first phase of Fanatics Markets will offer those prediction trades on sports, finance, economics and politics in partnership with Crypto.com . On Friday, it opens for business in the country's most populous states of California and Texas, which don't allow online sports betting, and in Florida, which does. That's not going to make the Seminoles happy. They have a monopoly on gambling in Florida for their Hard Rock International brand. One thing to remember as the sportsbooks jump into the prediction fray: They have experience spotting ""insider trading"" — the kind of game-rigging that leads to scandals that dominate headlines and produce federal criminal charges against well known athletes. On Tuesday I moderated a panel at the Hope Global Forum in Atlanta with three team owners: San Francisco 49ers' Jed York , Kansas City Royals' John Sherman and Atlanta Hawks' Tony Ressler . I asked them about the pitfalls of widespread sports betting; the threat of undermining public confidence in the integrity of professional sports; the harassment that athletes, coaches and referees are receiving from angry bettors; and how this plays out in the future. Ressler said the sports betting positives outweigh the negatives in terms of growing the fan base and increasing their engagement with the sport. But he pointed to player props being especially problematic. ""Every league, certainly in the NBA, has to figure out how to both have sports betting, but actually focus on the areas that are most susceptible to abuse,"" he said. We also talked about soaring team valuations, the potential for fractional ownership, and the challenges that come with college athletes getting paid through name, image and likeness deals. It's a conversation worth watching. But what's sticking with me is what York said at the end of the conversation: ""I just hope that we don't forget what makes sports special, and that's the fans that come into the game,"" he said, arguing arenas and stadiums are the last good semblance of a public square. ""[It's] where you meet other people you don't know. You have a shared experience, I think that's something that makes our country and our world special.""

2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"RFK Jr.’s vaccine panel weakens recommendation on hepatitis B shot for babies, scrapping universal guidance","Dr. Vicky Pebsworth, from left, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Retsef Levi, Case Western Reserve University Professor Catherine Stein and Dr. Raymond Pollak, listen to presentations during an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting to discuss childhood vaccine schedule changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., December 4, 2025.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked vaccine committee voted on Friday to do away with the long-standing, universal recommendation that all babies receive a hepatitis B shot at birth, issuing weaker guidance for certain infants.

The group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that parents use individual decision-making in consultation with a health-care provider to determine when or if to give the hepatitis B birth dose to a baby whose mother tested negative for the virus. For babies who don't receive the birth dose, the committee recommended that they wait to receive a first vaccine until they are at least 2 months old.

The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still has to sign off on that new recommendation. The CDC currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, regardless of their mother's testing status.

The move overturns that guidance, which has been credited with driving down infections in children by 99% since it was first introduced three decades ago and is widely considered to be a public health success story. Some committee members and public health experts warn that the change could have wide-ranging consequences, such as an increase in infections among kids.

The vote only affects the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between 6 and 18 months of age.

All pregnant people are supposed to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy. During previous meetings, some advisors questioned the need for babies to receive a shot if their mothers test negative.

But test results can produce false negatives, some people become infected later in pregnancy after being tested and babies can get infected by other members of their household.

The panel's closely watched two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost.

Eight members voted yes, while three voted no. Some advisors strongly pushed back on the new guidance ahead of the vote.

""This has a great potential to cause harm, and I hope that the committee accepts the responsibility when this harm is caused,"" said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, psychiatrist and voting member.

Dr. Cody Meissner, voting member and professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said he hopes that pediatricians will continue to administer the birth dose within the first 24 hours of delivery and before discharge from the hospital.

""To follow any other course is not in the interest of infants,"" he said.

Meissner added that more children will be injured and will catch hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. Infants are more vulnerable to developing chronic hepatitis B infections, which have no cure.

""We will see hepatitis B come back,"" he said. ""The vaccine is so effective. It does not make sense in my mind to change the immunization schedule.""

In a statement Friday, the American Medical Association said the vote is ""reckless and undermines decades of public confidence in a proven, lifesaving vaccine."" The group added that the decision was not based on scientific evidence and ""creates confusion for parents about how best to protect their newborns.""

Meanwhile, Retsef Levi, a voting member and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, falsely claimed during meetings that experts have ""never tested"" the hepatitis B vaccine ""appropriately.""

Some committee members raised concerns about vaccinating during the so-called neonatal period, which is a critical window of development for the brain and immune system. But decades of evidence show that the hepatitis B shot has been safely administered to newborns.

Other advisors said there is no evidence supporting the two-month delay to the birth dose.

""We have to make decisions with the data that we have, and we must use only the credible data to make the decisions, and not speculations and not hypotheses,"" said Hibbeln.

A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.

Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies, so the new recommendations should not have a material impact on their businesses.

Still, Merck said in a statement Friday that it is ""deeply concerned"" by the vote, which it said risks ""reversing this progress and puts infants at unnecessary risk of chronic infection, liver cancer and even death."" The company added that ""there is no evidence delaying it provides any benefit to children.""

In a statement, GSK said, ""we await additional information and an official adoption of today's recommendations by CDC to fully understand the potential impact.""

The panel's vote will not affect insurance coverage for the shots, including under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, Andrew Johnson, principal policy analyst for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, told the members during the meeting.",['Annika Kim Constantino']
2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"Core inflation rate watched by Fed hit 2.8%, delayed September data shows, lower than expected","A key inflation measure was lower than expected in September, the Commerce Department said Friday in a report delayed by the government shutdown that gives a further green light for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, indicated a 0.2% monthly rise while the annual rate was 2.8%. The monthly rate was in line with the Dow Jones consensus, but the annual level was 0.1 percentage point lower. The core annual rate edged down from 2.9% in August.

In addition, headline PCE increased 0.3% for the month, putting the annual inflation rate also at 2.8%, according to the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Both of those readings were in line with expectations though the annual rate was up 0.1 percentage point from August.

Federal Reserve officials use the PCE price index as their primary policy tool for inflation. While officials look at both measures, they generally consider core a better indicator of longer-term inflation trends.

""The slightly stale September inflation report shows that prices remained reasonably stable despite tariffs and healthy consumer spending. This probably provides further air cover for the Fed to cut rates in December,"" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy.

Goods prices surged 0.5% on the month as President Donald Trump's tariffs continue to work their way through the economy. Services prices were up just 0.2%. Food rose 0.4% while energy was up 1.7%.

The report also showed the personal savings rate was unchanged from August at 4.7%.

The release was put off several weeks by the government shutdown, which had caused a halt to all data collection and economic reports.

In addition to the inflation figures, the release provided information on income and spending.

Personal income rose 0.4% on the month while spending was up 0.3%. Income was 0.1 percentage point above the forecast, while spending was 0.1 percentage point below the forecast.

Stocks added to gains following the release as traders anticipate a quarter percentage point interest rate cut from the Fed when it announces its rate decision Wednesday.

Odds of a rate cut when the Fed convenes next week held at 87.2% following the report, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge. The interest rate decision will be announced Wednesday.

Though the September data is backward-looking, it is the last price reading the Fed will get before its monetary policy meeting next week.

However, policymakers have been unusually divided in what the next steps should be for rates.

One FOMC faction supports additional cuts as a way to head off further weakness in the labor market, while another sees continued threats from inflation that would require holding rates in a more restrictive position.

Recent labor market indicators show a slow pace of hiring, with some private data points exhibiting an increasing level of layoffs. Labor Department data, though, actually showed a decline last week in initial unemployment benefit claims.

A separate economic report Friday showed consumer sentiment a bit better than expected to start December.

The University of Michigan's consumer survey came in at 53.3, up 4.5% from November and better than the Wall Street estimate for 52. Inflation expectations also dropped, with the one-year view falling to 4.1% and the five-year at 3.2%, both at their lowest levels since January.",['Jeff Cox']

2025-12-01 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,U.S. announces zero tariff pharmaceutical deal with Britain,"U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hold a press conference following their meeting at Chequers, near Aylesbury, Britain, Sept. 18, 2025.

The United States announced a deal with Britain for zero tariffs on pharmaceutical products and medical technology on Monday which will lead to Britain spending more on medicines.

The deal included an increase in the percentage of the state-run National Health Service (NHS) budget that is spent on medicines.

""The United States and the United Kingdom announce this negotiated outcome pricing for innovative pharmaceuticals, which will help drive investment and innovation in both countries,"" United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement.

The office of the USTR statement said that Britain would increase the net price it pays for new medicines by 25% under the deal. In exchange, UK-made medicines, drug ingredients and medical technology would be exempted from so-called Section 232 sectoral tariffs.

Two sources familiar with the deal said it involved a major change in the value appraisal framework at NICE, a UK government body that determines whether new drugs are cost-effective for the NHS, the sources said.

NICE's ""quality-adjusted life year"" measures the cost of a treatment for each healthy year it enables for a patient, with the upper threshold being 30,000 pounds ($39,789) per year.

U.S. President Donald Trump has pressed Britain and the rest of Europe to pay more for American medicines, part of his push for U.S. medicine costs to be brought more in line with those paid in other wealthy nations.

The pharmaceutical industry has criticized a tough operating environment in Britain and some major firms have cancelled or paused investment in Britain, including AstraZeneca , the largest firm on the London Stock Exchange by market value.

One point of contention between the sector and the government has been the operation of a voluntary pricing scheme which sees firms put a proportion of sales to the NHS back in to the health service.

The office of the USTR said Britain had committed that the rebate rate would decrease to 15% in 2026.",[]
2025-11-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"From stocks to property, here’s what the Autumn Budget means for UK assets","U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves delivered her long-awaited Autumn Budget on Wednesday, which included a swathe of tax hikes that will impact most of the British population. CNBC rounded up the headline announcements for investors and spoke to market watchers about the implications for U.K. assets. Stocks and bonds Among the raft of measures announced Wednesday was a three-year exemption from stamp duty — a 0.5% tax investors pay when buying U.K. stocks — for shares of newly listed companies. David Smith, portfolio manager at Henderson High Income, said that while the move was welcome, the government ""could be more ambitious to boost the attractiveness of the U.K. market."" ""Currently, the UK's 0.5% stamp duty charge is an outlier among major global financial centers such as New York and Frankfurt,"" he said. ""It is a cost that not only reduces the value of savings but also increases the cost of equity capital for U.K.-listed companies, potentially leading to lower valuations."" However, the overall policy mix unveiled on Wednesday left many investors feeling optimistic about the outlook for tradeable U.K. assets. Benjamin Jones, global head of research at Invesco, argued U.K. stocks currently offer ""a wealth of opportunities."" ""Compared to other regional equity markets, U.K. stocks are still trading on lower multiples meaning there is still far less optimism priced into U.K. domestic share prices,"" he said. ""The budget is not pleasant, but it is not Armageddon. It doesn't change much in the way we should think about investing but clears some of the uncertainty we think has been holding back household spending and investing, and companies investing and hiring."" The budget is not pleasant, but it is not Armageddon Global head of research at Invesco Benjamin Jones When it comes to U.K. government bonds — known as gilts — Evangelia Gkeka, senior analyst for fixed income strategies at Morningstar, said the budget reinforces a ""cautious yet constructive"" outlook for investors. On Wednesday, gilt yields seesawed as the contents of the budget were accidentally leaked early by the Office for Budget Responsibility. The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt was last seen trading 5 basis points higher at 4.479% — but Gkeka argued that yields had shown modest movements around the budget ""in the grand scheme of things."" ""This stability is positive for investors, reflecting a more predictable market environment and provides attractive entry points for long-term exposure to elevated real yields,"" she said. Savings and investments Tax breaks on savings are also being reformed in a bid to incentivize investment in the U.K. market. Currently, British savers can save up to £20,000 ($26,441) a year in an ISA — a type of bank account — without paying tax on any earned interest. From April 2027, this will be slashed to £12,000 for people under the age of 65, in a bid to encourage young people to invest rather than save. Sally Conway, savings expert at Shawbrook — a British lender that listed on the London market last month — said cutting the cash ISA allowance delivers a blow to many savers. ""For those focused on financial resilience and building a cash nest egg, reducing the tax-free room they have to save will make that job harder,"" she said. ""It will be more important than ever for people to review how their money is split between cash ISAs, standard savings accounts and, where appropriate, investment ISAs. Shopping around for competitive rates, using a mix of easy access and [fixed-term] products, and ensuring emergency savings sit in the most appropriate accounts can help soften the impact of this change."" Reeves also announced Wednesday that existing taxes on savings interest will rise by 2 percentage points in 2027. The vast majority of U.K. taxpayers do not pay savings tax, but for those who are liable, income tax for savings income will be 22%, the higher rate will be 42%, and the additional rate will be 47%. Meanwhile, taxes on dividends will rise in April next year. Investors in the basic and upper income tax bands will see duties on dividends increase by 2 percentage points, to 8.75% and 35.75%, respectively. Property The government is creating a new separate tax rate for property income, which is already subject to income tax. From April 2027, the property basic rate will be 22%, the higher rate will be 42%, and the additional rate will be 47%. Aside from increasing taxes on property income, a so-called ""Mansion Tax"" is set to be introduced in England from 2028. Homes worth more than £2 million will be liable for a new surcharge between £2,500 and £7,500 a year, depending on the valuation given to the property. An estimated 150,000 households could be impacted by the Mansion Tax, according to Fidelity. Oliver Loughead, wealth manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, advised those set to be impacted by the Mansion Tax to carefully consider their choices. ""Downsizing could become a more practical option — but it still shouldn't be an automatic decision,"" he said. ""Start by calculating the expected annual cost of the tax versus the financial and lifestyle impact of moving. In some cases, the tax may be smaller than the stamp duty, selling fees and disruption involved in downsizing. [But] if your property is significantly above the threshold and you already feel over-housed or want to release equity, downsizing can meaningfully reduce your long-term expenses."" Meanwhile, Nick Mann, private client property partner at law firm Collyer Bristow, warned the new tax could have unintended consequences for the U.K.'s wider real estate market. ""It is likely to put off some buyers who will now look to purchase below £2 million, therefore creating a two-tier market above and below £2 million,"" he said. ""Whilst the market below [the threshold] will be buoyant, it will have a significant impact on slowing the market for properties valued above £2 million, particularly in London and the southeast [of England]."" Pensions Private pensions are also subject to the tax hikes, with tax breaks on salary sacrifice pension contributions set to be reduced from 2029. Currently, workers who are enrolled in salary sacrifice pension schemes can pay some of their earnings into a private pension before tax is deducted from their paycheck — leaving them with less taxable pay. When the changes are brought in, any salary sacrifice pension contributions over £2,000 a year will be liable for National Insurance — a form of tax on income. Charlene Young, senior pensions and savings expert at AJ Bell, said the bigger blow will be delivered to employers. Companies already saw their National Insurance bills hiked in last year's Autumn Budget , which businesses warned would weigh on the labor market. ""While salary sacrifice currently helps workers save up to 8% employee NI on the cost of their pension contributions, the savings on offer are bigger for employers,"" Young said in a note. ""There is no upper threshold for employer NI, so they will face a 15% charge on the full value of sacrificed contributions over the £2,000 cap. Some generous employers have previously rewarded employees by sharing all or some of their saving, but it's likely the added costs to payroll will lead to reward schemes being watered down or withdrawn."" Frances Li, founder and director of London-based Biscuit Recruitment, labeled the changes to pension savings ""a hit to mid-career professionals."" ""Now they face a difficult choice: Save for the future or protect their take-home pay. We may start to see employees lower pension contributions just to stay afloat month to month,"" she said. ""A professional earning £45,000 to £55,000 could find that a promotion leaves them only marginally better off once tax, NI and pension limits are factored in. That's already shaping how some candidates approach their career decisions.""",['Chloe Taylor']

(Photo credit should read Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing via Getty Images)

Yields on the benchmark 10-year gilt were last seen 6 basis points lower, while shorter-term 5-year gilt yields fell by more than 5 basis points. When the report was initially released, 10-year yields fell as much as 4 basis points, before reversing course to gain as many as 4 basis points.

U.K. government borrowing costs were rocky on Wednesday after the country's Office for Budget Responsibility unexpectedly released its economic and fiscal forecasts ahead of the Autumn Budget.

The OBR was scheduled to publish its forecasts following the budget, which Finance Minister Rachel Reeves began delivering in parliament at 12:30 p.m. London time (7:30 a.m. ET).

As she began speaking, Reeves labeled the early release of the OBR's outlook ""deeply disappointing and a serious error on their part.""

In a statement, the OBR said the link to its outlook went live on its website ""too early this morning"" and had since been removed.

""We apologise for this technical error and have initiated an investigation into how this happened,"" it said, noting that the mistake would be reported to its oversight board and the relevant government bodies.

In its report, the fiscal watchdog gave details of tax-raising measures that will be announced in the budget, including freezes on income tax thresholds, taxes on private pension contributions that exceed £2,000 a year, new mileage-based taxes on electric vehicles, and an annual tax on homes valued above £2 million ($2.6 million).

The budget will see taxes on dividends, property and savings income increased by 2 percentage points, the OBR also revealed, which is expected to raise £2.1 billion.

New spending policies, including the removal of a so-called two-child limit on welfare, will increase public borrowing by £7 billion next year, the OBR forecast, and by £11 billion in 2029-30.",['Chloe Taylor']

This report comes at a time when ""rapid technological change, geopolitical uncertainty and profound societal transitions make dependable talent metrics more essential than ever,"" said Rafael Escalona Reynoso, CEO of Portulans Institute.

This year's report, themed ""resilience in the age of disruption,"" ranked 135 economies globally on 77 indicators such as soft skills and AI talent concentration across six pillars.

In its 11th edition this year, the index — produced by business school INSEAD and in partnership with D.C.-based think tank Portulans Institute — measured how countries grow, attract and retain talent across all income groups.

Singapore has claimed the top position in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI) for the first time, bolstered by its robust education systems, sound governance and a proactive approach to sustaining an adaptive, innovation-ready workforce in the age of artificial intelligence.

While historians can give us more perspective, it certainly feels as if we are living in a period of maximum disruption and anxiety.

""While historians can give us more perspective, it certainly feels as if we are living in a period of maximum disruption and anxiety,"" said INSEAD's dean of research and innovation, Lily Fang. ""Geopolitical uncertainty poses massive challenges to the resilience of global commerce and markets, while artificial intelligence presents both amazing opportunities to enhance human potential — but also unfathomable risks.""

Here are the top 10 countries in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index:

Singapore Switzerland Denmark Finland Sweden Netherlands Norway Luxembourg United States Australia

Notably, Switzerland was leapfrogged by Singapore and fell from its top position for the first time in the history of the GTCI. However, the country records multiple top-five results across the study's framework, including internet access in schools (1st), government effectiveness (2nd), and AI skills migration (4th).

High-income European countries continue to dominate the ranking, accounting for seven of the top ten positions.

Switzerland, Denmark and Finland closely follow each other in the top ten, ""suggesting a shared focus on enabling and retaining talent through favorable conditions and access to opportunities,"" according to the report. These three countries consistently rank near the top in enabling and retaining talent.

Several Nordic countries have jumped places in the top ten since the last GTCI in 2023. Denmark moved up one position to 3rd this year from 4th in the 2023 report, Finland jumped two places from 6th to 4th, and Sweden jumped four places from 9th in rank in 2023 to 4th this year.

Meanwhile, the United States fell from third place in 2023 to ninth in this year's report — its weakest showing since 2013.

Although the U.S. scored strongly in areas such as enabling and growing talent, ""slight declines in the categories of openness and lifelong learning"" pushed the country down to ninth place in 2025, according to the report.","['Ernestine Siu', 'In Ernestinesiu']"

CNBC spoke with several business and tech leaders at the CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore about the challenges and opportunities presented by the adoption of AI.

""If you look at AI, what does it do? It actually improves human productivity,"" Alibaba's chairman Joe Tsai told CNBC's David Faber.

""Look at global GDP. About $100 trillion of global GDP, 60% of that is labor income. Let's say 20% of that $60 trillion can be enhanced by AI, and AI can do the job at a 20% discount on the price. That's a $10 trillion total addressable market,"" Tsai said.

""Name another industry that has a ten trillion TAM. That's why everybody should be excited about AI,"" he added.

Other industry heavyweights weighed in on AI's biggest growth opportunities.

""The place to be is the infrastructure of AI because over the next two, three, five years, that's where the multiple expansion occurs, and you want to extract profit from it, rather than the revenues,"" said Kamal Bhatia, president and CEO of Principal Asset Management.

Discussions about the future of work were also high on the agenda.

""We're moving from a 'doing revolution' to a 'thinking revolution.' And frankly, we're moving away from something that impacted the blue collar and the lower workforce into a way that is impacting professional services and white collar, and leadership at a far faster capability,"" Peta Latimer, president of Mercer Asia, told CNBC's Julia Boorstin.

""When we talk about the worker, we can no longer talk about job descriptions. We need to start talking about workflows because when you talk about workflows, then the worker actually has a role in whatever job is coming up,"" added Guy Diedrich, SVP and Global Innovation Officer at Cisco.

According to a 2025 report from McKinsey, more than 70% of all employees surveyed think that generative AI will change 30% or more of their work within two years. The same report states that 92% of companies plan to increase their AI investments by 2028.

Here's why,"Vince Nguyen, a 39-year-old entrepreneur based in Vietnam, spends a few hundred dollars almost every month traveling to other countries to play pickleball. The sport, which began as a pastime after he injured himself in American football, has since become central to his lifestyle, as he plays it for 2 to 4 hours almost daily. Since he picked up the sport two years ago, Nguyen has played leisurely in Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam and Canada. Next month, he is planning to head to China for an upcoming tournament. He says he forks out a few hundred dollars on round-trip flights to Taiwan or Malaysia for tournaments and leisure play with friends. Additionally, he pays court fees ranging from $4 to $8 for open play and about $38 a night for hotels. In total, the trips cost him between $386 and $772. However, he spends almost $1,000 when traveling to Canada, where flights and indoor courts are pricier than in Asia. ""I like to spend a week ... playing a few times, checking out different courts, going to different restaurants,"" he said.

Nguyen believes traveling to play pickleball makes a difference as ""every country has a little bit different style"" in playing the game, and he is not alone. He is one of the many millennials who are fueling a rising trend in travel: sports tourism. According to Hilton's 2026 Trends Report, which polled over 14,000 travelers across 14 countries, about 67% of millennials have planned a trip for events related to their interests, including sports, wellness and concerts. In the U.S. alone, millennials are 80% more likely to plan a vacation for tennis and 87% for pickleball, according to a survey by online travel agency Priceline on travel trends in 2025. And there are no signs of sports tourism slowing down. The sports tourism industry is already a $707.29 billion market and is forecasted to nearly triple by 2032, according to Fortune Business Insights. Europe leads the market with a valuation of $248.23 billion last year. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific has been marked the fastest-growing region, anticipated to be worth $149.50 billion in 2025. Sports tourism in Asia-Pacific is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 17.85% from 2025 to 2032.

""Good for your soul""

Another millennial, 35-year-old Nirbhay Handa, who is based in Singapore, also travels abroad for tennis. ""I'll go to a tennis camp in Phuket … when I travel to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, I have a tennis coach that I just go and play with in the evenings after work,"" he said. ""I think this makes me better at work, because I'm in a better mood,"" the entrepreneur said. He will also bring his tennis racket with him whenever he travels for business or leisure. He said he has spent around $200 a week on tennis sessions in Dubai. Handa said that the sport is more than a hobby to him. ""It just became very therapeutic, and it put me on to some good habits … not drinking till late on Friday … giving up social smoking completely,"" he added. He makes it a point to play a game of tennis when he's abroad for leisure or business. Tennis, which he deems ""good for your soul,"" not only helps him unwind but also fulfils his social life. ""It does a little bit of what going out to a pub would do for a lot of people, you know, which is meeting people, meeting your friends over a drink,"" he said, but ""I feel like I can do that at the tennis court.""

Hitting personal goals

Mike Goldys, who lives in Florida, travels to surf overseas with a goal of playing in as many different surf parks as possible. The 39-year-old has logged 140 hours so far across 26 cities in 10 countries. ""Each surf park … is very unique for me. I … just can't get enough of it, he said. ""I want to keep checking them off and seeing what this one was like in this state."" ""I rarely go back to the same wave pool twice,"" he added. Goldys has spent $18,500 on surf sessions alone, budgeting $6000 to $10,000 per trip depending on flights and accommodation, he said. He also sets aside money for photography and videography to share on social platforms.

2025-11-22 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,U.S. moves to tame the skies as disruptive passenger incidents reach new highs,"The U.S. Department of Transportation on Wednesday launched a nationwide campaign urging travelers to improve their behavior at airports and on flights, as disruptive incidents remain far above pre-pandemic levels.

The effort, called ""The Golden Age of Travel Starts with You,"" aims to restore civility in the skies and address a surge in disruptive behavior. The department said the initiative is meant to ""jumpstart a nationwide conversation around how we can all restore courtesy and class to air travel.""

Disruptive passenger incidents doubled in 2024 compared with 2019, while in-flight outbursts — ranging from inappropriate behavior to physical attacks — surged 400% by 2025.

The Department of Transportation said the campaign aimed to improve the travel experience while ensuring the safety of passengers, flight crew and airport staff.

In a video promoting the campaign, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged travelers to consider their conduct, asking whether they help pregnant passengers or older adults with overhead luggage, or simply say ""please"" and ""thank you.""

He also asked passengers to ""dress with respect"" ahead of the holiday travel season.

Of the 82 million Americans expected to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday, about 6 million are expected to commute by plane this year, or a 2% increase from 2024, according to a forecast by the American Automobile Association.

International tourism grew 5% in the first half of 2025 from a year ago, reaching almost 690 million passengers, the United Nations World Tourism Organization said. That figure is 4% above the comparable period in 2019.

The U.S. isn't alone in pushing for better passenger behavior. The United Kingdom's aviation industry introduced the ""One Too Many"" campaign in 2018 to curb alcohol-related incidents.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency also launched an initiative in 2019 to raise awareness of unruly behavior, noting then that unruly passengers threaten flight safety every 3 hours, with 70% of incidents involving some form of aggression.

In 2015, China also began a blacklist of passengers who are disruptive on flights after a series of high-profile incidents.

Despite these measures, reports of unruly passenger incidents continue to climb. More than 53,000 incident reports were filed by over 60 operators worldwide, or one incident for every 395 flights in 2024, the International Air Transport Association said in June. That compares with one incident for every 405 flights a year earlier.","['Kaela Ling', 'In Jamiekaela-Ling']"

""If someone offered me a different passport, or my children a different passport, I would grab it with both hands,"" said Alex, who asked to be identified only by her first name for privacy reasons.

South Africa's passport ranked 51 in The Henley Passport Index, which firmly places it in the middle of the global list that is based on the number of destinations holders can visit without a travel visa.

People with strong passports, including friends, typically don't understand the cost, time and frustrations of traveling on a passport that doesn't sit near the top of the list, Alex said.

""Why do I have to upload every single page of my passport from 10 years ago to go on holiday to Australia? If you're traveling for business, what you have to go through... is crazy.""

A recent trip to Europe with her partner required visas to the Schengen Area as well as the United Kingdom, a process that took six weeks. ""We had to be very careful with timelines,"" she said.

As she had to turn in her passport for the visa application, she was unable to travel during the entire process. ""If you're someone like me, who travels regularly for work, it's an issue.""

Preparing a stack full of documents can also be a frustrating experience for those not holding a top-ranked passport.

Alex said a previous visa application to Europe required her financial statements to be stamped by the bank — a detail she learned only after visiting the visa center. Unfortunately, she couldn't find a bank branch willing to provide this service. After multiple rejections, one agreed to print watermarks for $10 per page.","['Kaela Ling Monica Pitrelli', 'Kaela Ling', 'In Jamiekaela-Ling', 'Monica Pitrelli', 'In Monicapitrelli']"

""Lifestyle and boutique hotels are defined by their unique, exclusive environment versus the standardized experience of traditional hotels,"" according to a downloadable version of a separate JLL report examining lifestyle hotels in Asia-Pacific. The difference between them, the report states, is that boutique hotels are independent or chains run by families, whereas lifestyle hotels are operated by established hotel companies. Growth in the past five years has been strongest in Asia-Pacific, where room supply quadrupled from 2014 to 2024 — and is set to grow another 34% by 2027, the report showed. China has the most lifestyle hotel supply in the region, followed by Southeast Asia, which has three times more rooms than Australia, New Zealand and South Asia, according to JLL. However, Australia and New Zealand displayed the strongest growth in lifestyle rooms supply on the back of surging demand for unique and experience-driven travel, the company said. Lifestyle brands are expected to continue expanding in Asia on the back of investor and guest demand, JLL added, particularly for brands that have been recently acquired by international hotel chains, such as NoMad (acquired by Hilton), CitizenM (acquired by Marriott), and The Standard (acquired by Hyatt).

Why Gen Z job hunting is out of control right now

Gen Z is graduating into one of the toughest job markets in years. Hiring is frozen, layoffs are rising, and entry-level roles are disappearing as companies rethink budgets and lean on AI.

2025-12-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"This is the No. 1 way to be happier, expert says—and it'll only take you 15 minutes","There's a lot of advice out there about how to increase the amount of joy in your life.

For example, leading happiness researcher and expert Arthur Brooks has 10 tried-and-true ways to be happier, he wrote in his book ""The Happiness Files: Insights on Work and Life.""

Gretchen Rubin, happiness expert and author of ""The Happiness Project,"" offers up 12 secrets to creating a happier life, including practicing self-compassion and embracing failure.

But if you ask Sonja Lyubomirsky, she'll tell you that the best way to be happier is to ""feel more connected to other people.""

Lyubomirsky is a happiness researcher and distinguished professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside.

There are many ways to go about this, she says. Practicing gratitude and performing acts of kindness can make one feel more deeply connected to others, for example.

But the No. 1 way to forge connection, Lyubomirsky says, is to have a conversation with someone, be it your mom, your roommate, or even your mailman. And it doesn't even have to be all that long.

""If you have a 15-minute or a 30-minute conversation with a stranger,"" she says. ""You're going to be happier.""

When engaging in one of these chats, make sure it's not a superficial one, Lyubomirsky says. Make it a meaningful conversation, where you're both sharing something that reveals a deeper part of yourself and listening intently.

Lyubomirsky suggests sharing how you feel about a book you've just read or movie you've watched. Try talking a bit about how you're feeling that day, she says.

For a deeper, more probing conversation, Lyubomirsky says you can start with any of the following questions:

What's been on your mind a lot lately?

What's the best thing that happened to you this year?

What's the worst thing that happened to you this year?

What are you looking forward to most in 2026?

What's a mistake that you made this year that actually turned out to be a good thing?

Which family member surprised you the most this year and why?

Lyubomirsky also likes the physical card deck series {THE AND}, which offers talking prompts for various types of relationships.

These conversations don't have to happen in person, she says. Lyubomirsky and her team have found that even when people have a 30-minute Zoom call with someone, it ""totally lifts their mood.""

Shares of the social media giant rallied more than 5% to $676 each at Thursday's highs after Bloomberg reported that Zuckerberg is set to reduce metaverse spending up to 30%. The metaverse group, which works on the company's virtual ""Horizon World"" environment and Quest line of virtual reality headsets. It's been a long time coming. Meta stock took a beating back in 2022 when, in addition to aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to combat sky-high inflation, investors grew concerned that Zuckerberg was going to spend countless sums of money building out a virtual world with little idea as to when, or even if, the investment would see any return. Since then, Zuckerberg has smartly avoided much talk about the metaverse. Wall Street is wondering whether cutting the metaverse budget is a true turning point for Zuckerberg, who has been on an artificial intelligence spending spree, both on the capital expenditures side and in poaching AI talent for top dollar, or whether it's more about facing the reality that he's been throwing good money after a vanity project that no one cares about. That spending question has been top of mind as Meta shares have dropped more than 20% since reporting earnings in late October , on fears that Zuckerberg was losing his way on efficiency and preparing to continue to ramp up investments without a clear view on returns. Judging by Thursday's rally in Meta shares, the Bloomberg report has eased some of those concerns. We remember the power of spending discipline: Zuckerberg dubbed 2023 the ""year of efficiency,"" embarking on massive layoffs and cost-cutting. Shares surged nearly 195% in 2023, followed by a 65% gain last year. The metaverse and other VR-related investments are housed within the company's Reality Labs operating segment, alongside the company's smart glasses. Reality Labs lost just over $4.4 billion in the last quarter alone, with Bloomberg highlighting more than $70 billion in losses since its launch in 2021. The article does not appear to indicate a pullback in smart glasses investments, which, by all indications, have been better received by the mass market than the company's virtual reality offerings. Bloomberg does report that Zuckerberg still believes in the metaverse and thinks that people will one day work and play in virtual worlds. META 5Y mountain Meta Platforms 5 years Our view? While focusing on a future metaverse isn't wrong, it's just a difficult narrative for investors to digest. When folks hear the term metaverse, they think about a digital playground that is nothing more than a highly immersive video game or entertainment experience. From that point of view, it's easy to understand the skepticism about a return on investment on such a big swing. As Meta shareholders for the Club, we applaud any decision to cut spending on the more ambitious aspects of the metaverse vision, but take a different view of Zuckerberg's north star. The technology needed to achieve his vision will still be invested in, just in a more methodical manner. Zuckerberg is choosing to focus on the technology that can be monetized more quickly, such as smart glasses and AI, while leaving open the idea of a metaverse-like world in the future. You aren't going to be able to run a fully immersive digital world, in which players/users can interact, without AI. So, rather than talk about the grand vision of a metaverse, Zuckerberg can simply talk about AI and how it's helping in the here and now, by reducing costs and boosting engagement, while aiding topline growth. That's a narrative investors are all too happy to talk about. The recently released display glasses — which take the idea of smart glasses to the next level without the bulk of VR goggles — would certainly lend themselves to user interactions in a virtual environment. By tying that effort to the screenless Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses, Zuckerberg has a better chance to start monetizing the research R & D investments that went into the metaverse in the first place. We think that Zuckerberg's long-term view hasn't changed so much as he has learned to be more methodical in his long-term investing roadmap, while at the same time becoming a better storyteller as it relates to the narrative of these investments. We think this bodes well for 2026 earnings – perhaps a cost guidance cut with the next earnings release – and perhaps, even more important given Meta's already attractive valuation, a reversal of the negative sentiment since the company last reported what were nothing short of fantastic quarterly results. Analysts at Mizuho are out with a note following the Bloomberg report, saying such metaverse cuts could add as much as $2 to 2026 earnings per share. Assuming a valuation multiple of 20 to 25 times earnings, that would be expected to add anywhere from $40 to $50 to the share price. ""The stock is up, but it's not up nearly as much as I think it could be given the fact that it's only up 13% for the year, and is not expensive on a P/E multiple,"" Jim Cramer said Thursday during the Club's Morning Meeting . On a forward basis, the stock trades at 22.3 times full-year 2026 earnings estimates. That's right in line with the S & P 500 's valuation, despite expectations that Meta can grow earnings twice as fast in the coming year as the overall market.

Pop star Sabrina Carpenter on Tuesday blasted the Trump administration for using her hit 2024 song ""Juno"" as the soundtrack for a TikTok video showing Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detaining people during raids.

""This video is evil and disgusting,"" Carpenter wrote on X, in response to the White House posting the ICE video on TikTok.

""Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda,"" she added.

The clip posted by the White House begins with footage of a protest against ICE operations before cutting to a montage of agents handcuffing and detaining people.

The soundtrack features a viral lyric from ""Juno"": ""Have you ever tried this one?""

The caption on the White House's post echoes the lyric: ""Have you ever tried this one? Bye-bye.""

Carpenter typically performs the song on tour with a playful skit involving pink furry faux handcuffs.

Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI is expected to close a $15 billion round at a $230 billion pre-money valuation next month, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber.

The deadline for allocation is the end of day on Tuesday, with the round expected to close on Dec. 19, the sources said.

This confirms earlier CNBC reporting that the company was raising $15 billion. The Tesla CEO later called the report on the round ""False"" in a post on the social media platform X.

At the time, sources told CNBC that xAI would use a large portion of the money for funding graphics processing units responsible for powering large language models.

CNBC had previously reported in September that the startup was looking to raise $10 billion at a $200 billion valuation.

The funding round is yet another sign of the insatiable demand for AI tools. Companies, including OpenAI and Anthropic, have raised billions and reached sky-high valuations as investors pour more money into companies building foundational AI models.

Sam Altman's OpenAI finalized a $6.6 billion-share sale at a $500 billion valuation last month, and Reuters recently reported that the ChatGPT maker was eying a $1 trillion initial public offering.

Anthropic closed a $13 billion funding round in September that roughly tripled its valuation from March.

Musk's xAI is responsible for creating the Grok chatbot that has come under fire for disseminating hate speech, including antisemitic content. The company recently debuted Grokipedia, an AI-powered competitor to Wikipedia.

Photographer: Will Oliver/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Meta halted internal research that purportedly showed that people who stopped using Facebook became less depressed and anxious, according to a legal filing that was released on Friday.

The social media giant was alleged to have initiated the study, dubbed Project Mercury, in late 2019 as a way to help it ""explore the impact that our apps have on polarization, news consumption, well-being, and daily social interactions,"" according to the legal brief, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.

The filing contains newly unredacted information pertaining to Meta.

The newly released legal brief is related to high-profile multidistrict litigation from a variety of plaintiffs, such as school districts, parents and state attorneys general against social media companies like Meta, Google's YouTube, Snap and TikTok.

The plaintiffs claim that these businesses were aware that their respective platforms caused various mental health-related harms to children and young adults, but failed to take action and instead misled educators and authorities, among several allegations.

""We strongly disagree with these allegations, which rely on cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture,"" Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement. ""The full record will show that for over a decade, we have listened to parents, researched issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens—like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with controls to manage their teens' experiences.""

A Google spokesperson said in a statement that ""These lawsuits fundamentally misunderstand how YouTube works and the allegations are simply not true.""

""YouTube is a streaming service where people come to watch everything from live sports to podcasts to their favorite creators, primarily on TV screens, not a social network where people go to catch up with friends,"" the Google spokesperson said. ""We've also developed dedicated tools for young people, guided by child safety experts, that give families control.""

Snap and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The 2019 Meta research was based on a random sample of consumers who stopped their Facebook and Instagram usage for a month, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit alleged that Meta was disappointed that the initial tests of the study showed that people who stopped using Facebook ""for a week reported lower feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and social comparison.""

Meta allegedly chose not to ""sound the alarm,"" but instead stopped the research, the lawsuit said.

""The company never publicly disclosed the results of its deactivation study,"" according to the suit. ""Instead, Meta lied to Congress about what it knew.""

The lawsuit cites an unnamed Meta employee who allegedly said, ""If the results are bad and we don't publish and they leak, is it going to look like tobacco companies doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves?""

Stone, in a series of social media posts, pushed back on the lawsuit's implication that Meta shuttered the internal research after it allegedly showed a causal relationship between its apps and adverse mental-health effects.

Stone characterized the 2019 study as flawed and said it was the reason that the company expressed disappointment. The study, Stone said, merely found that ""people who believed using Facebook was bad for them felt better when they stopped using it.""

""This is a confirmation of other public research (""deactivation studies"") out there that demonstrates the same effect,"" Stone said in a separate post. ""It makes intuitive sense but it doesn't show anything about the actual effect of using the platform.""



Stone pushed back further on the lawsuit's characterization of the study on Monday via separate posts on X, emphasizing that the portion of the study that the filing highlighted was only a ""pilot"" test that was one part of multi-tiered research.



""The study was intentionally designed to overcome expectation effects in order to understand the real impact of deactivation. It included a staged approach, starting with a pilot to see if these efforts would work,"" Stone said in the X posts. ""Unfortunately, they did not. And that is the reason this study did not continue.""

Meta won its high-profile antitrust case against the Federal Trade Commission, which had accused the company of holding a monopoly in social networking.



In a memorandum opinion released Tuesday, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said the FTC failed to prove its argument. The case, initially filed by the FTC five years ago, centered on Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. ""Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now,"" Boasberg said in the filing. ""The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so. A judgment so stating shall issue this day."" Boasberg dismissed the case in 2021, saying the agency didn't have enough evidence to prove ""Facebook holds market power."" In August of that year, the FTC filed an amended complaint with more details about the company's user numbers and metrics relative to competitors like Snapchat, the now-defunct Google+ social network and Myspace. After reviewing the amendments, Boasberg in 2022 ruled that the case could proceed, saying the FTC had presented more details than before. ""We are deeply disappointed in this decision,"" said Joe Simonson, the FTC's director of public affairs. ""The deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg, who is currently facing articles of impeachment. We are reviewing all our options."" Republicans in Congress have called for Boasberg to be impeached because of rulings he has made against immigration-related actions by the Trump administration, and for signing off on subpoenas for phone records of GOP lawmakers as part of special counsel Jack Smith's investigation of President Donald Trump's efforts to undo his 2020 election loss.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former operating chief Sheryl Sandberg, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom, and other current and former Meta executives all testified in the trial, which began in April. The social media company's shares fell less than 1% on Tuesday. The stock is up about 2% for the year, badly underperforming broader indexes and most of its megacap tech peers. ""The Court's decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition,"" the company's chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead said in a statement. ""Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America."" The ruling comes a little over two months after Google avoided the harshest possible penalty from an antitrust case it lost last year. While Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided the company would not be forced to sell its Chrome browser, bucking the Department of Justice's request. Google was, however, ordered to loosen its hold on search data.

In the Meta case, the FTC claimed the company shouldn't have been allowed to buy Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, and the agency called for those units to be divested. The commission also alleged that there were no major alternatives for apps like Facebook and Instagram that people use to communicate with friends and family in a online, social space. However, a major challenge for the FTC, according to the judge, was in proving that Meta is breaking antitrust law today, not years ago when the primary use of social networks was very different and based on sharing other kinds of content. ""To win the permanent injunction that it seeks here, the FTC must prove a current or imminent legal violation,"" he wrote. Boasberg ultimately sided with Meta's argument that the technology industry has evolved since the early days of Facebook, and the company now faces a wide variety of competitors like TikTok. ""While each of Meta's empirical showings can be quibbled with, they all tell a consistent story: people treat TikTok and YouTube as substitutes for Facebook and Instagram, and the amount of competitive overlap is economically important,"" Boasberg wrote. ""Against that unmistakable pattern, the FTC offers no empirical evidence of substitution whatsoever."" Much of Boasberg's conclusion was built on the transformation that's taken place in the social media market in recent years and Meta's changing position within it. User trends have moved heavily in the direction of video, where TikTok and YouTube have massive user bases and huge network effects.

Boasberg explained that there was enough evidence to show ""that consumers are reallocating massive amounts of time from Meta's apps"" to those services and others, which has ""forced Meta to invest gobs of cash to keep up."" ""Meta is not a monopolist insulated from competition,"" he wrote. ""The Court finds the evidence favoring Meta on this issue both credible and convincing."" Boasberg also cited various documents and testimony from ""industry insiders"" that show how other tech companies like TikTok and YouTube viewed Meta as serious competition.

For Cami, running the business as her only job is a welcome change of pace, she says. She worked almost full-time as a nurse at a hospital while simultaneously running the laundromat from October 2020 to April 2023, when she quit nursing. (Cami requested to be identified by her nickname only, due to security concerns over her cash-heavy business. Her identity and the name of her business are known to CNBC Make It.) ""Now, I'm only working maybe five or six hours a week [running the laundromat],"" says Cami. ""But I also am hesitant in telling people that, because that's not how it was five years ago, four or three years ago. I was working a lot more hours trying to grow this business."" In that time, she hired employees — the laundromat employs six people, including one part-time worker — so she can ""focus more on growing the business and not working in the business,"" she says. Cami also spends about 10 hours per week creating and posting videos on social media about her business and the experience of running it, she notes. DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss Cami's laundromat brought in roughly $475,000 in revenue last year, plus nearly $30,000 in rent from a salon that operates next door, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. That included about $119,000 in profits — some of which went back into the business, and $66,000 of which became Cami's salary, she says. She also made about $22,000 from six months of social media posting in 2024, and is on track for a significant bump — ""around $200,000"" — in 2025, she says. And though she misses the camaraderie of the hospital, she enjoys the work-life balance and freedom she's experienced with business ownership, she says. ""This is my first time where I'm able to be home for all the holidays, have every weekend off,"" says Cami. ""I never have to go to a boss or a manager to be able to take off on a random trip home or anything like that. So my freedom of time has been completely changed.""

Selling her home to buy her business

After 13 years of working as a nurse, primarily in the bone marrow transplant unit of a large hospital, Cami was ready for a change, she says. She just didn't want to re-enroll in school to do so. ""And so I knew, really my only way out of working would be to own a business,"" she says. She looked into a couple ventures, including renting out storage units and buying a mobile home park. Then she saw a listing for the laundromat on bizbuysell.com, a marketplace for buying and selling small business. A friend referred Cami to his uncle, who owned two laundromat locations himself, she says. ""He looked at the numbers with me, and he said something that I will never forget. He said, 'You know, if I could go back in time ... I would never go to college. I would never get my master's degree,'"" says Cami. ""He's like, 'All I would do is buy laundromats, because laundromats scream money.'"" Cami planned to buy a business for about a year before actually making a purchase, she says, and selling her house to help fund the expense was part of that plan. She sold her house for $310,000 in April 2020 and moved into a rental home, she says.

Cami's laundromat brought in roughly $475,000 in 2024 revenue, documents show. CNBC Make It

Because her mortgage wasn't fully paid off, she received about $150,000 in equity from the transaction to put toward the $300,000 laundromat, she says. She took another $50,000 from her savings to make a $200,000 down payment on the laundromat in October 2020, she says. ""We seller-financed the remaining $100,000 with a 6% interest rate over the next two years,"" says Cami, adding that she paid the loan off in about a year and a half. ""[Selling my house] wasn't very scary. I was more excited about owning a business rather than owning a home."" The laundromat had already been functioning for over 20 years and was ""cash flowing,"" says Cami. She put $20,000 toward renovations like new lighting, flooring and fresh paint to make it feel more ""homey,"" she says. She's currently paying off two loans for washing machine purchases and two loans for vehicles for her laundromat's pickup and delivery services, totaling ""about $4,900 a month"" in payments, she says. As she ran the laundromat, she gradually decreased her hours per week at the hospital. She bought a new house in April 2023, she says.

The lucrativeness of laundry

At Cami's laundromat, machine prices range from dryers that cost 25 cents per seven minutes to 80-pound washers that cost $12 per load. Laundry pickup and delivery prices vary depending on the job, too. Cami didn't have any prior leadership or business ownership experience, which was ""the biggest learning curve,"" she says. She says she listens to business podcasts, reads books and tries to attend ""at least one or two laundromat conferences a year"" to stay up-to-date on industry trends, software and technology. One of the biggest lessons she's learned, she says: Make money and use it to follow your passions outside your job, rather than pursuing a career around your passions. In her case, her passions are time with her loved ones and control over her schedule, she says: ""My days are a lot smoother [that way].""

Artificial intelligence startups have reached sky high valuations in recent months as they raise massive amounts of capital to power seemingly endless demand for foundational models.

In September, AI startup Anthropic closed a $13 billion funding round that roughly tripled its valuation from March.

Sam Altman's OpenAI in October closed a $6.6 billion share sale at a $500 billion valuation. Last month, Reuters reported that the ChatGPT maker was prepping for an IPO that could value it at $1 trillion.

Musk's AI venture has repeatedly stirred controversy, including with its rapid build-out of large, power-hungry data centers in Memphis.

2025-11-08 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Underwater cables are a vital piece of the AI buildout and internet — investment is booming,"Over 95% of international data and voice call traffic travels through nearly a million miles of underwater communication cables. These cables carry government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming around the world. The first commercial telecommunication subsea cable was used for telegraphs and was laid across the English Channel between Dover, England and Calais, France in 1850. The technology then evolved to coaxial cables that carried telephone conversations, and most recently, fiber optics that ferry data and the internet as we know it. ""About ten years ago, we saw the advent of another big category, which is the webscale players and the likes of Meta , Google , Amazon , etc., who represent now probably 50% of the overall market,"" said Paul Gabla, chief sales officer at Alcatel Submarine Networks. Alcatel is the world's largest subsea cable manufacturer and installer, according to industry trade magazine Submarine Telecoms Forum. Demand for subsea cables is increasing as tech giants race to develop computation-intensive artificial intelligence models and connect their growing networks of data centers. Investment into new subsea cable projects is expected to reach around $13 billion between 2025-2027, almost twice the amount that was invested between 2022 and 2024, according to telecommunications data provider firm TeleGeography.

Big Tech, big cables

""AI is increasing the need that we have for subsea infrastructure,"" said Alex Aime, vice president of network investments at Meta. ""Oftentimes when people think about AI, they think about data centers, they think about compute, they think about data. But the reality is, without the connectivity that connects those data centers, what you have are really expensive warehouses."" In February, the company announced Project Waterworth, a 50,000km (31,000-mile) cable that will connect five continents, making it the world's longest subsea cable project. Meta will be the sole owner of Waterworth, which the company says will be a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar project. Amazon also recently announced its first wholly-owned subsea cable project called Fastnet. Fastnet will connect Maryland's eastern shore to County Cork, Ireland, and capacity will exceed 320 terabits per second, which is equivalent to streaming 12.5 million HD movies simultaneously, according to Amazon. ""Subsea is really essential for AWS and for any connectivity internationally across oceans,"" Matt Rehder, Amazon Web Services vice president of core networking, told CNBC in an interview about Amazon's subsea cable investments. ""Without subsea you'd have to rely on satellite connectivity, which can work. But satellite has higher latency, higher costs, and you just can't get enough capacity or throughput to what our customers and the internet in general needs.""

Google is another large player, having invested in over 30 subsea cables. One of the company's latest projects is Sol, which will connect the U.S., Bermuda, the Azores and Spain. Microsoft has also invested in the infrastructure. ""You've seen this huge growth in submarine cables over the past 20 years. And this is driven by just a voracious demand for data,"" says Matthew Mooney, director of global issues at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.

Cut cables

Disruptions due to cable damage can be quite significant, particularly in areas served by few internet connections. ""If you cut a cable, you can cut off multiple countries from internet access, and that includes financial transactions, banking, e-commerce and basic communications,"" said Erin Murphy, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonprofit national security research organization. That very thing happened to Tonga, an island nation east of Australia. In 2022, debris from an underwater volcanic eruption severed the island's only subsea communication cable, cutting the island off from the rest of the world. In September, cuts to subsea cables in the Red Sea caused disruptions to Microsoft's Azure cloud service. The company was able to re-route traffic, but users in Asia and the Middle East still faced increased latency problems and degraded performance. Experts have said that the majority of subsea cable damage is accidental, usually due to fishing activity or a ship accidentally dropping its anchor on a cable. But lately, these cables are becoming the suspected targets of sabotage.

""When you have so many vessels in international waters that are highly trafficked by lots of commercial vessels or fishing vessels, the likelihood of accidents is fairly high,"" Murphy said. ""But if you're a hostile actor, you know that as well. So if you're sending out the so-called Russian ghost fleet, or if you have a Chinese fishing vessel and a cable is accidentally cut, you could just say, 'Oh, well, it was an accident.' But it could be intentional. So it's really hard to discern sometimes when an act of damage is actually intentional or accidental."" Mooney and Recorded Future have been tracking some of these cases of suspected sabotage. ""I would say that we have seen a significant uptick in what we would consider intentional damages,"" Mooney said. ""In 2024 and 2025, [we] saw a notable increase in incidents that occurred in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan. And so it is difficult to be able to determine with 100% validity that these are intentional. However, the fact patterns that emerge from these events does give you cause to be suspicious that they could all be considered accidental."" Mooney said the increase in suspected sabotage has corresponded to increased tensions between Russia and Ukraine and China and Taiwan. Despite there being a lack of concrete evidence of subsea cable sabotage, governments are taking the threat seriously. In January, NATO launched the ""Baltic Sentry"" following several incidents of cable cuts in the Baltic Sea. The operation involves deploying drones, aircraft and subsea and surface vessels to safeguard the subsea infrastructure in the region. ""As a result, I don't believe we've seen any instances of cable severing since late January 2025, in the Baltic Sea,"" Mooney said.

Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli. Courtesy of Scale AI.

After Meta shocked the tech world in June by announcing plans to invest $14.3 billion in Scale AI, primarily as a way to hire the startup's founder, Alexandr Wang, and a handful of his employees, the future of Scale was immediately thrown in doubt. OpenAI soon disclosed that it had been winding down its work with Scale, which prepares the data that artificial intelligence labs and big tech companies use to train their models. Companies including Google and Elon Musk's xAI also paused work with Scale after the deal, according to multiple media reports. But almost five months after the blockbuster announcement, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has a very different message to share. The 1,000-plus person company, he says, is alive and well. ""People mischaracterize this deal as some sort of acquihire or some sort of licensing deal, which is not true,"" Cinelli, who joined Scale in 2022, told CNBC in an interview. ""We're a company that has signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two, three months."" Founded in 2016, Scale is best known for its data business where it competes with companies including Appen, Surge AI and Mercor. Scale also has an applications business that creates custom solutions to help governments and large enterprises deploy AI. The U.S. Department of Defense signed a $99 million contract with Scale in August, followed by another $100 million contract in September.

Cinelli, 42, said both parts of the business are growing and bringing in revenue that's ""well into the nine figures,"" though he declined to share more specific revenue numbers. The startup generated close to $1 billion in revenue last year, before the Meta deal, a spokesperson told CNBC in August. Whether Scale has a viable path forward has been a big topic in Silicon Valley. The Meta transaction was lumped in with a number of acquihires that have taken place in the industry, though at a notably higher price. Since early last year, Microsoft , Amazon and Google have each orchestrated deals to bring in top AI talent and license certain technology without having to face the regulatory hassles that come with full-blown acquisitions. In July, Google spent about $2.4 billion to hire Windsurf co-founder and CEO Varun Mohan and other senior research and development employees. The agreement didn't include an investment and came with a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf's technology.

Already exited?

Greg Martin, who works on pre-initial public offering stock sales as managing director at Rainmaker Securities, called the Meta-Scale arrangement a ""quasi-acquihire,"" and said investors don't know what to make of the company because ""it doesn't feel like it can go public anymore."" He said he's seeing much more investor interest in names like Anthropic and xAI. ""People don't truly understand what the future exit is for Scale,"" Martin said. ""Or did it kind of already have its exit?"" Scale has been trying to convince potential investors, employees and customers otherwise. Jason Droege, who was promoted to interim CEO at Scale from strategy chief following Wang's departure, said in a blog post days after the deal was announced that the startup wasn't pivoting or ""winding down.""

Cinelli said that Scale continues to work with ""all the major AI labs and tech companies,"" though he declined to comment on specific customers. ""We had conversations, everyone had questions, naturally,"" he said. ""We're still an independent company, we're not captive to Meta, we're still in business with all our customers. Once we've gone through those conversations, I think everyone kind of understood."" OpenAI, Google and xAI are not currently listed as customers on Scale's website, and representatives from the companies didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment. Meta is named as a client.

Scaling after Wang

Wang, who's now 28, became the world's youngest self-made billionaire by building Scale, though he lost that title to Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan, 27, in October, according to Forbes. Wang's departure was a big loss for the company, but Cinelli said the ""vast majority"" of employees are still there. With its investment, Meta has a 49% stake in a company valued on paper at $29 billion. But Meta has no voting power, a Scale spokesperson told CNBC in June, and there's no product integration between the two companies. Cinelli said Scale's data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future, Cinelli said. Still, Scale has resized. In July, Droege shared that the company was laying off 200 full-time employees, or roughly 14% of its workforce. ""These changes will make us more nimble — enabling us to react more quickly to shifts in the market and customer needs,"" Droege wrote in a memo at the time. On Tuesday, Scale said it's looking to hire 200 people for new roles across all areas of the business. The company is also expanding to larger offices in New York, Washington, D.C., St. Louis and London.

Scale's largest hub is in San Francisco, where it occupies about 180,000 square feet of space that was previously used by Airbnb. ""We're doubling down on growth,"" Cinelli said. Scale still has a long way to go to justify its latest valuation, which is more than double its $13.8 billion value from its last fundraise in 2024. Cinelli said he's confident the issue will ""solve itself."" The company has $1 billion on the balance sheet, Cinelli said, so it doesn't need to raise more money anytime soon. Scale also has a new focus, which Cinelli said has helped in recruiting, pushing its offer acceptance rate to the highest ever. Under Wang's leadership, Scale's mission was to ""strengthen human sovereignty.""

Subsea fiber-optic communication cables carry over 95% of international data and voice traffic across the globe. These cables transmit hundreds of terabits of data per second including government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming.

Amazon has invested in several subsea cable projects in the past, including Jako, Bifrost and Havfrue as part of a consortium, but Fastnet is the first time that the tech company undertakes one of these projects alone.

""Subsea is really essential for for AWS and for any connectivity internationally across oceans,"" Matt Rehder, Amazon Web Services vice president of core networking, told CNBC in an interview about Amazon's subsea cable investments.

""Without subsea you'd have to rely on satellite connectivity which can work,"" he said. ""But satellite has higher latency, higher costs and you just can't get enough capacity or throughput to what our customers and the internet in general needs.""

Amazon says that Fastnet's capacity will exceed 320 terabits per second, which is equivalent to streaming 12.5 million HD movies simultaneously. The company is building this cable to meet rising demand for cloud computing, artificial intelligence and edge applications that use Amazon Web Services.

Fastnet will also strengthen Amazon's network resilience. Amazon did not say how much Fastnet would cost to construct, but the company said it expects it to be operational by 2028. Other technology giants including Google, Meta and Microsoft have also been investing in subsea cable infrastructure.

The Club is bumping Meta stock up to our buy-equivalent 1 rating — a move under consideration after the earnings release, when we opted to reiterate our $825-per-share price target. During Thursday's Morning Meeting , Jim said members should feel free to buy the Meta dip. But he urged would-be buyers to wait until Friday, giving the stock a chance to settle out. Jim attributed the decline to investor rejection of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's argument to spend more to front-load AI capacity. ""It's the way he said it. He said, 'Trust me, it's good. Even if I buy too much, it's fine.' That did not sit well with Wall Street."" Zuckerberg said on the earnings call that any excess computing capacity can be used in other parts of the business. A large part of the spending will be going toward Meta's ability to produce ""very high-quality good video,"" Jim said, giving advertisers more creative tools. ""It will help increase the amount of content inventory that can be shown in Instagram and Facebook — and, therefore, should enable an increase in engagement."" That dynamic will be ""fantastic for advertisers"" and for Meta since it makes most of its money from digital ads, Jim added. Earlier Thursday, Jim knocked down concerns about Zuckerberg ""spending recklessly,"" saying he likes the CEO's ""I'm gonna win no matter what"" mentality. ""I have not made a lot of money betting against his man,"" Jim added. Aside from the spending and expense worries, Meta did deliver better than expected quarterly revenue and a beat on adjusted earnings per share.

These companies are "" afraid to scare their investors, and so they are telling them they need a lot less capital, a lot less energy than they know they actually do,"" Lonsdale, who previously co-founded Palantir , told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday.

This dynamic will create a continuous cycle where executives look for more capital and energy every three to six months to power their initiatives, Lonsdale said.

Tech giants have ramped up spending on AI in recent months to build out infrastructure and lure top talent. Some skeptics worry that a bubble is forming and that companies are overspending with no clear path to a return on investment.

""If anything I think we're underestimating how much investment is going to go into this space and how much we're going to need,"" Lonsdale said.

2025-10-29 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Wall Street hates Meta's AI spending guidance raise. We don't,"Meta Platforms shares were taking a beating in extended hours trading on Wednesday after management raised its expense guidance and took a massive tax charge. Revenue in the three months ended Sept. 30 climbed 26% year over year to $51.24 billion, easily outpacing the consensus estimate of $48.14 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $7.25 versus the $6.69 consensus, LSEG data showed. That earnings number does not include a nearly $16 billion, or $6.20 per share, one-time income tax charge due to the implementation of President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Bottom line Given the non-recurring nature of the charge and reassurances from CFO Susan Li on the post-earnings conference call, we don't think the stock's 7.5% decline is due to the tax change. Li said, ""We continue to expect we will recognize significant cash tax savings for the remainder of the current year and future years under the new law, and this quarter's charge reflects the total expected impact from the transition to the new U.S. tax law."" Rather, the pressure on the stock was almost certainly due to management's expense guidance raise for the remainder of 2025, with Li reiterating prior commentary that capital expenditure ""dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025, with growth primarily driven by infrastructure costs, including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation."" Total expense growth is also expected to ""grow at a significantly faster percentage rate in 2026 than 2025,"" management also noted on the release. META YTD mountain Meta Platforms YTD We understand the capex concerns as the market tries to figure out what the long-term return on these monstrous artificial intelligence-driven investments is. But management has a good handle on things, with optionality and the ability to adapt depending on how things play out. To this point, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the call, ""The right strategy [is] to aggressively frontload building capacity. So, that way we're prepared for the most optimistic cases. That way, if superintelligence arrives sooner, we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift in many large opportunities."" In AI terms, superintelligence is when computers become smarter than humans. Zuckerberg added, ""If it [superintelligence] takes longer to achieve, then we'll use the extra compute to accelerate our core business, which continues to be able to profitably use much more compute than we've been able to throw at it. And, we're seeing very high demand for additional compute, both internally and externally. And, in the worst case, we would just slow building new infrastructure for some period while we grow into what we build."" That Meta can profitably leverage even more compute than it already has should ease the minds of some investors when it comes to the massive spending. Meta is clearly going to find use for all the infrastructure it's building, one way or another. It's better to have it and not need it immediately than need it immediately and not have it. While there is always the potential for return on investment (ROI) to materialize more slowly than expected or at a lower rate, it should nonetheless be positive over time. Why we own it Meta Platforms dominates the world of targeted ads with excellent technology, and its strong user engagement makes it a great place to advertise. The company's scale provides the financial power and employee talent needed to pursue new growth avenues such as artificial intelligence. Competitors : Alphabet , TikTok, and Snap Weight in portfolio : 4.69% Most recent buy : Sept. 6, 2022 Initiated : May 29, 2014 With these internal safety nets in place, the team is right to front-load the spending as the potential opportunity is simply too big to miss, and the stakes are simply too high. When technology as consequential as AI comes around, it's either get with the program and fight to lead the way, or risk being disrupted by those who are willing to spend, which, at this point, is just about everyone. On the call, Zuckerberg further explained the internal benefits of building out more AI infrastructure. ""The upside is extremely high for both our existing apps and new products and businesses that are becoming possible to build across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. Our AI recommendation systems are delivering higher quality and more relevant content, which led to 5% more time spent on Facebook in Q3 and 10% on Threads. Video is a particular bright spot, with video time spent on Instagram up more than 30% since last year."" Outside of the one-time earnings hit – which we think the Street is looking past – and the spending dynamics, there really wasn't much to take issue with in the third quarter report. In fact, everything else was fantastic. Revenue in both segments outpaced expectations, while the Family of Apps operating income came in better than expected, and the operating loss at Reality Labs was nearly $700 million less than expected. Sales were better than expected across all geographies. Engagement, as represented by Family Daily Active People, was well ahead of expectations, as was Family Average Revenue per Person. Free cash flow came up a hair short on the back of elevated capex, but was pretty much in line thanks to a solid beat on operating cash flow versus expectations. We're reiterating our Meta price target of $825 per share and discussing whether to upgrade the stock to our buy-equivalent 1 rating. We currently have it as a 2 rating, which means look to buy on a pullback. We have to consider that while down after the release, the stock was up 28% year to date as of Wednesday's close. Quarterly highlights Instagram reached 3 billion monthly active users, while Threads recently passed 150 million daily actives with Zuckerberg saying it ""remains on track to become the leader in its category."" Reels reached an annual revenue run rate of over $50 billion. On the call, Zuckerberg noted the ""annual run rate going through [Meta's] completely end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion."" Meta AI has over 1 billion monthly active users, with the team seeing increased usage as the underlying models improve. New Meta Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses are selling well. Zuckerberg said the new Meta Ray-Ban display glasses ""sold out in almost every store within 48 hours, with demo slots fully booked through the end of next month."" Total ad impressions across all services increased 14% year over year, with Li saying it was ""healthy across all regions, driven by engagement and user growth, particularly on video services."" Average price per ad increased 10% year over year. Regarding cash returns to shareholders, Meta returned $3.2 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and another $1.3 billion via dividends. Guidance Meta expects current fourth-quarter revenue in the range of $56 billion to $59 billion, which even on the low end, easily surpasses the consensus expectation of $54.95 billion, according to LSEG. Management, as mentioned earlier, raised the lower end of its full-year capital expenditures forecast. They are now targeting between $70 billion and $72 billion, up from the prior range of $66 billion to $72 billion. This new range is above the $68.36 billion consensus estimates, according to FactSet. Meta also raised the lower end of its 2025 total expenses guidance to between $116 billion to $118 billion, up from the prior range of $114 billion to $118 billion.

Meta shares dropped as much as 9% on Wednesday after the company reported third-quarter earnings that beat on sales, but it also reported a $15.93 billion one-time tax charge.

Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

Earnings per share : $7.25 adj. vs. $6.69 estimated

: $7.25 adj. vs. $6.69 estimated Revenue: $51.24 billion vs. $49.41 billion estimated

Meta said that the implementation of President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act resulted in the one-time, non-cash income tax charge. The company said it expects Trump's law to result in ""a significant reduction"" in its U.S. federal cash tax payments for the rest of 2025 and future years.

The company's third-quarter sales rose 26% year-over-year, which is its highest revenue growth since the first quarter of 2024.

Meta said it expects fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $56 billon to $59 billion. The midpoint of that range comes in above what was expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

The company raised the low end of its total expenses for the year by $2 billion, saying expenses will come in between $116 billion to $118 billion. That figure was previously $114 billion to $118 billion.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta consistently requires more computing power for its artificial intelligence initiatives, resulting in more spending on related data center and cloud services.

""That suggests that being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over, over some period,"" Zuckerberg added.

The company also raised its 2025 guidance for capital expenditures, which will now come in the range of $70 billion to $72 billion. It's prior outlook was between the range of $66 to $72 billion.

Meta's Reality Labs hardware unit reported a third-quarter loss of $4.4 billion on $470 million in sales.

Revenue for Reality Labs in the fourth quarter is expected to come in lower than it did for the same period in 2024, Meta finance chief Susan Li said on a call with analysts. Li said that was due to the company not releasing a new VR headset this year and because retailers who bought inventory of Meta's previous headset for the holiday shopping season did so during the third quarter.



""We're still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we've introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets,"" Li said.

The company in September revealed the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which are Meta's first consumer-ready AI glasses with a built-in display and an accompanying wristband with neural technology. Zuckerberg said the product is sold out and that demo slots are booked through the end of November.



""We're going to have to invest in increasing manufacturing and selling more of those,"" he said.

The company said that it saw 3.54 billion daily active people across its apps for the quarter, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of 3.5 billion daily active people.

Meta's advertising sales were $50.08 billion during the third quarter, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of $48.5 billion.

The company has spent the year investing heavily in AI, and it conducted a massive overhaul of the organization leading those efforts after the lukewarm debut of its open-source Llama 4 software in April.

Meta said last Wednesday that it would lay off about 600 workers in its Superintelligence Labs AI unit, but it left that group's top-tier TBD Labs unscathed. A day before, Meta said it formed a joint venture agreement with Blue Owl Capital in a deal worth $27 billion to help fund and build a gigantic data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana.

Meta said that its employee headcount was 78,450 as of Sept. 30, representing an 8% year-over-year increase.

The company in September added Vibes to its Meta AI app. That feature is a feed of AI-generated videos. Since Vibes was released, downloads of Meta AI on both iOS and Android are up 56% month-to-month to a total of 3.9 million downloads as of Oct. 18, according to data provided to CNBC by mobile research firm Appfigures.

""Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI, and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more novel types of content ahead,"" Zuckerberg said.

Correction: Analysts expected Meta revenue to come in at $49.41 billion. That number was misstated in the earlier version of this story.

2025-12-03 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Why aspirational luxury shopping is losing steam — and what’s ahead in 2026,"For the first time in years, analysts are feeling optimistic about luxury. Next year, the sector will finally return to growth, market watchers say, yet companies' performance is likely to diverge based on their level of exposure to different segments of the customer base, making stock picking key for luxury investors in 2026. J.P. Morgan predicts the sector will stabilize in 2026 following a tough 2024 and volatile 2025, with improvements driven by an uptick in Chinese consumer confidence and product innovation. Luxury groups have been contending with notable sales declines over the past two years. Following a post-pandemic boom, companies struggled to gain momentum as consumers held off spending amid higher costs of living and worries about job security. Despite popular belief, the luxury sector isn't all about the ultra-wealthy shoppers residing in London's Mayfair or walking down New York's Fifth Avenue. So-called aspirational luxury shoppers, consumers who can afford some entry-level luxury items but are not part of the ultra-rich demographic, are just as important. ""High-end jewelry, watches – the hard luxury, the ultra-luxury – is doing well, but the middle has fallen off, and the bottom is falling out,"" founder of 5 New Digital Michael Zakkour, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday. ""The aspirational luxury buyer has virtually disappeared."" 'Soft luxury' like leather goods, handbags and clothing is in a tough spot, said Zakkour, ""because the aspirational luxury buyer who might be saving for a long time to buy a $3,000 handbag, they're just not doing it anymore."" Polarized performance J.P. Morgan analysts predict that heightened macro volatility as well as low visibility on the wealth effect – the idea that people spend more when they feel wealthier due to an increase in the value of assets like property or equities – will lead to a polarization of performance. The analysts' top choice is Richemont , seeing strong momentum for its brands Cartier and Van Cleef. They also like Moncler , Ferragamo , LVMH and Prada . Like J.P. Morgan, UBS analysts are similarly hopeful that the worst is over for luxury and predict the sector will see about 5% organic sales growth across their coverage next year. That should be enough to drive an uptick in profitability after two years of margin pressures, they noted in analysis last week. UBS is cautiously optimistic about soft luxury names and expects an uptick for them in 2026 but still foresees a continued outperformance of jewelry which typically relies on a more affluent customer base. A point of disagreement is Burberry , the British brand recognizable by its distinct check-patterned scarves and clothing. While UBS likes Burberry as ""a key turnaround story for now"" and gives it a buy rating, J.P. Morgan downgraded the stock to underweight last Friday. Consensus is too optimistic about the improvements expected at Burberry next year, J.P. Morgan said in analysis Friday. ""Burberry has shown a stabilization of its sales densities in the last 12 months; however, we think execution risk becomes higher from here, now that some of the easy fixes (e.g. reinforcing scarves and outerwear, improving marketing campaigns and brand messaging) have been implemented."" Risks remain The wealth effect is currently supporting strong U.S. demand, however, it goes both ways. Hence, demand could be at risk if the stock market corrects. Given recent market jitters about high valuations and an AI bubble , that risk has become even more pronounced. China is another pressure point. While the country's consumers have shown signs of recovery, especially in the most recent earnings cycle , many say it is too early to talk about a full rebound. Chiara Battistini, J.P.

Speculation about a possible dual listing, with the group currently listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has persisted since 2022, when Prada's Paolo Zannoni told Bloomberg it was an option but not a priority.

""We continue to believe it is the right thing to do. We will not commit to a timeline until that timeline is six months away,"" he added.

Luxury stocks broadly experienced a slowdown after a Covid-19 pandemic-fueled boom and a plateau in Chinese traction. Bonini said that he sees the sector ""stabilizing,"" meaning a resurgence in consumption could be on the cards.

2025-11-10 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,A global wealth boom is fueling a rise in family office imposters,"A global wealth boom is fueling the creation of a record number of family offices. And that has come with a peculiar problem: imposters. Fundraisers and fraudsters are presenting themselves as family office representatives, seeking to dupe gullible investors — and then there are also imposters who are in it just for an ""ego boost,"" several industry veterans told CNBC. ""Fake family offices have been growing exponentially,"" said Ronald Diamond, who runs Diamond Wealth and a co-investment syndicate of more than 100 families. ""Right now, the family office space is where all the money is. So everyone, every bank, every law firm, every accountant firm, wants some [of that money]. So if you say you have a family office, everybody wants to talk to you,"" he said. Last year, a Singapore resident was found guilty for masquerading as a representative of a prominent family office and running a $10 million scheme that duped people into investing in pre-IPO tech companies such as Airbnb . He impersonated Man Capital executives by creating fake email domains and online profiles, pretending to have ties to one of Egypt's most prominent business families, lulling his victims into a false sense of security before defrauding them. Some people don't do it for the money, but for their self esteem and self worth. They think if a bank takes them out for lunch and people court them, it means they're loved. Prestel and Partner Family Office Conferences Tobias Prestel Genuine family offices largely do not raise money from the public or sell investment products, they only manage and invest their own family's wealth, said experts. Not every imposter is looking to make a quick buck though. There are those who put on a charade not to defraud others, but to be recognized as important members of the society. They pretend to be a family office in order to gain a certain social status and respect. ""So they say, oh I'm the founder of a family office, just to hang with a crowd and be somebody,"" said Tobias Prestel, managing director at Prestel and Partner Family Office Conferences. ""If you say, I'm a family office, then banks invite you for lunch and asset managers take you out for dinner, and everybody who wants to sell you something treats you nicely."" Industry experts said the rise in fakes is a natural by-product of money and attention flooding into the space. According to Deloitte's most recent statistics, there were an estimated 8,030 single family offices worldwide as of 2024, up almost 31% over the last five years. The number is projected to rise by 12% to 9,030 by the end of 2025, and by 33% to 10,720 by 2030. Collectively, the funds they oversee are enormous — and continue to increase. In aggregate, family offices now manage about $3.1 trillion in assets under management and are expected to grow 73% to $5.4 trillion by 2030. Why fakes — and how to spot them An information vacuum seems to have encouraged imposters. In many markets, genuine single family offices, or SFOs, are exempt from registering — they do not need to be on a public regulatory register or need a license for fund management — so long as they manage only family money. That privacy norm often makes verification hard, said industry experts. For example, in Dubai, SFOs don't need a full financial license as long as they only manage money for one family. Similarly, family offices in the U.S. are usually exempt from registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission if they serve only one family and are wholly owned and controlled by family members. Single Family Offices are set up to manage family monies and should not be soliciting third party monies. Monetary Authority of Singapore ""Investors should understand more about the background of their investment partners before committing to any investment,"" said a spokesperson for Hong Kong's Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, adding that the public can contact the SFC should there be any enquiries about the background of a family office. The Monetary Authority of Singapore said that parties who are approached by entities soliciting for funds should verify their identities and whether or not they hold the appropriate license. ""Single Family Offices are set up to manage family monies and should not be soliciting third party monies. Any entity that solicits third party funds are required to hold a capital markets services license,"" an MAS spokesperson told CNBC. When asked about what steps the country had taken to prevent family office-related frauds, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said that it continues to ""work with partners to disrupt crime, including scams and illegal financial promotions."" The Dubai Financial Services Authority declined to comment, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, largely closed due to a government shutdown, did not respond. It also does not help that some wealthy individuals are generally very private, and have little to no information that can be accessed online. Diamond underscores the practical challenge: ""It's hard to do background checks on billionaires, right? Because they are so usually so private."" As such, family offices are increasingly relying on each other to compare notes. The industry vets one another through community references and proof of behavior. That is something investors too can try before putting money into any schemes suggested by some family office representative. Diamond said the fastest filter for him is to call a few established families within the geography and inquire. If no one has heard of them, that could be a potential red flag, warranting deeper research. Similarly, Ryan Lin from Bayfront Law, who liaises with Chinese family offices in Singapore, pointed to a strong family office association in the city-state, saying that representatives at times conduct checks through a WhatsApp group. ""I mean, if I've not heard of this [family office] and they claim that they have been in Singapore for 30 years, then something is wrong,"" he said. The alarm bells would be if someone comes up to me and goes: 'hey, I'm a wealthy second generation from a family in Singapore.' Then proceed to send me a brief of 400 to 500 words trying to prove this. CEO of Canopy Mu Chen Industry veterans suggested seeking information on past investments, co-investment partners, as well as trying to verify the source of wealth can help ascertain the genuineness of purported family offices. Overcompensatory behavior to prove legitimacy tends to raise alarm bells, too. Mu Chen, CEO of Canopy, who liaises with family offices setting up in Singapore, said that family offices generally do not tend to share too much information, and rarely lead with a product push — these people get courted often, and its's not the other way around. ""Genuine family offices have people come after them a lot,"" he said. ""The alarm bells would be [ringing] if someone comes up to me and goes: 'hey, I'm a wealthy second generation from a family in Singapore.'

In August, the White House imposed 39% trade tariffs on Swiss exports to the U.S., citing the country's large trade surplus with the States as the main justification for the hike. The Swiss government refrained from retaliatory measures, choosing instead to continue negotiations with Washington. No trade deal has been reached yet. Following Trump's tariffs announcement, Swiss watch exports drop by 16.5% in August from a year earlier, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watchmaking Industry. Similarly, Barclays wrote in a note in October that Swiss watch exports dropped by 3.1% year on year in September. Usually Switzerland's largest export market, this decline was almost exclusively driven by the U.S., where exports plunged 56% after earlier spikes in April and July, linked to anticipation of U.S. tariff measures. Export volumes to the U.K. and Japan were higher than those to the U.S. over the same period.

2025-10-18 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"As secondhand luxury soars, authentication becomes a new gold standard","As the global market for secondhand luxury items surges, authentication has become the defining factor separating credible platforms from the rest. The resale market for fashion and luxury items is expanding at an annual rate of 10%, three times faster than the firsthand market, according to a report released Oct. 9 by Boston Consulting Group and luxury resale platform Vestiaire Collective. The report projects the global resale market could reach up to $360 billion by 2030, from about $210 billion today. With more shoppers buying pre-owned designer brands, trust has become paramount. ""As counterfeit manufacturing becomes increasingly sophisticated, even luxury brands themselves sometimes fail to detect fakes, in some cases, unknowingly repairing counterfeit items,"" said Jaewha Choi, CEO of South Korean online marketplace Bunjang. Horror stories abound online of people paying thousands for fake Hermès bags or a Rolex Oyster Perpetual watches with swapped parts. Some counterfeits are so convincing they are dubbed ""superfakes,"" reportedly made with materials from the same leather suppliers as the original brands.

Buyer beware

However, as the resale market expands, authentication has become a growing concern. The secondhand industry has long operated under the rule of ""caveat emptor,"" or buyer beware. To counter increasingly realistic ""superfakes,"" resale platforms are pouring resources into verification. Singapore-based online marketplace Carousell opened its first brick-and-mortar store for luxury items in downtown Singapore this year, allowing sellers to have their items graded by one of the company's appraisers before listing them for resale. The verification team inspects not only the material of a bag but also details like stitching and stamping, Tresor Tan, Director of Sales, Marketing and Client Relations at Carousell Luxury, told CNBC. ""At the end of the day, it's our reputation at stake as well,"" Tan said. ""And because of that confidence, we also offer our buyers a money-back guarantee on authenticity.""

watch now

The company has built a proprietary database covering almost 500 product styles, and higher-valued items go through multiple checks. In cases where the authenticity is in doubt, the items will not be listed, Tan said. South Korea's Bunjang has also followed in the same vein, developing its own proprietary authentication system that combines traditional visual inspections with scientific equipment and artificial intelligence ""trained on hundreds of thousands of data points,"" Choi told CNBC. Bunjang claims a 99.9% authentication accuracy rate in identifying genuine goods, and its verification system can continuously learn and adapt to counterfeiting methods by leveraging AI.

Trust fuels sales

Both Carousell and Bunjang said verification has boosted business. Bunjang said luxury goods now make up more than a quarter of its platform's $1.1 billion in annual gross merchandise value. Transactions and total value for luxury goods rose 30% year on year in the first half of 2025, Choi said. Carousell's Tan did not disclose specific figures but said the luxury segment has seen ""very strong interest"" and has recorded ""great growth."" This growth that began with Carousell's 2012 launch as an online platform eventually led to the opening of its first physical store. ""When someone is buying and selling a $100,000 watch on the platform, it definitely catches our attention,"" she said, saying that users wanted Carousell's oversight in high-value transactions. Along with its verification process, the store also offers a money-back guarantee for its products. Tan said that while prices may not always be the lowest in the market, the store aims to offer ""fair value."" ""We may be, say, $200 more expensive than what someone else is offering, but [consumers] will still ultimately weigh the different options for $200 savings,"" she said. ""Am I better off with a bit of assurance?""

Next wave of luxury consumers

Affordability is the top reason for buying secondhand luxury items, cited by 80% of respondents, according to BCG's report. But it's not just about saving money. Shoppers are increasingly drawn to rare or discontinued collections that are no longer available in stores, Samina Virk, Chief Marketing Officer and U.S. CEO of Vestiaire Collective, told CNBC.



""These motivations are getting stronger across the board as compared to surveys in previous years, showing that secondhand shopping is becoming a deeply ingrained part of how people engage with fashion today,"" Virk said.

But a vanilla latte in its cafe? A comparative steal at SG$9. From Ralph Lauren to Coach, Louis Vuitton, Dior and Prada, clothing and luxury brands are opening stores in Asia to connect with consumers who are increasingly prioritizing experiences over tangible purchases. This is especially true of Gen Zs, Coach CEO Todd Kahn told ""Squawk Box Asia"" Monday. ""Gen Z, across the globe, really focus on self-expression,"" he said. ""The cafes [are] really about extending that self-expression, that idea of community.""

Many Gen Zs are happy to share that ""self-expression"" online, resulting in free word-of-mouth advertising for concepts like Coach's ""chilli crab"" soft serve ice cream, that comes topped with a branded mantou, or fried bun, at its new cafe in Resorts World Sentosa.

Sunglasses and keychains may have been high-end fashion's gateway purchases of the past. Today, new consumers can get a taste of luxury for less — with first handbag purchases made of cake, rather than hand-stitched leather.

Coach's foray into food started in Asia, said Kahn, where the company experimented with different food and beverages concepts. The brand is set to open a Coach-branded steakhouse at Singapore's Jewel Changi Airport in October. Ultimately, company data showed coffee shops are ""probably the best format for us,"" he said. Coach cafes in areas of high foot traffic are profitable on their own, he said. Moreover, they sell more merchandise, often because shoppers' companions have a place to rest and relax, allowing shoppers more time to linger, he said. ""Where we have a coffee shop, we've seen somewhere between 15% and up to 35% better results in the core shop,"" he said. Coach has more than 980 stores globally, and its march into ""experiential retail"" may result in more than 100 coffee shops opening around the world in the next four years, he said.

Prices up, purchases down

Profits in the luxury industry nearly tripled from 2019 to 2024, according to McKinsey & Company's The State of Luxury report published in January. However, much of this growth — around 80% — was from price increases, not rising demand, it said.

2025-09-12 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,Rich Chinese are exiting Singapore as wealth regulations tighten: 'my patience is gone',"Singapore's reputation as a safe harbor for wealthy mainland Chinese families is fading, reversing an inflow that came at the expense of rival wealth hubs like Hong Kong and Japan. Its allure for China's wealthy surged after 2019, when a wave of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong led to a clampdown by Beijing and the introduction of a national security law the next year. These events pushed mainland Chinese families in Hong Kong to seek distance from Beijing's grip. Political stability, a favorable family-office regime, independent courts, and Mandarin fluency made Singapore a natural draw for China's super-rich. In the wake of a 3 billion Singapore dollar ($2.3 billion) money-laundering scandal in 2023 — dubbed the ""Fujian case"" where the culprits hailed from — Singapore's regulators and banks embarked on an aggressive clean-up, tightening rules and re-screening of wealthy clients. ""When the Fujian news broke, a lot of these wealthy Chinese left. So literally, almost all … they go to Hong Kong, the Middle East, Japan,"" said Ryan Lin, a director at Bayfront Law in Singapore . That departure has accelerated since then. Multiple layers of checks Lin, who vets and processes applications from wealthy Chinese individuals seeking to establish family offices or reside in Singapore, fielded 50% fewer applications from mainland clients now compared to 2022, especially as compliance checks and other new regulations come into force. From their point of view, [wealthy mainland clients] are thinking: Do I really need to declare my illegitimate son just because I want to manage wealth in Singapore? director at Bayfront Law Ryan Lin The Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) push to strengthen compliance, particularly around crypto, has further chilled interest, especially for those who found wealth in this specific space. In 2025, Singapore introduced regulations requiring platforms operating in Singapore offering products such as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins or tokenized equities, to customers outside the city-state, to be licensed. Singapore's central bank signaled approvals would be rare, while imposing steep compliance costs, including a SG$250,000 minimum capital requirement alongside strict anti-money laundering, technology risk, and conduct rules. Crypto firms offering services to customers within Singapore are already regulated under existing laws. ""So for this year, those who are in the crypto space particularly, they have all gone because of this particular legislation by the MAS,"" Lin said. ""It's already very hard to apply for a license in Singapore, and then you come out with another legislation targeting even services to people outside Singapore. So all of them left."" ""I still think [the exodus] is very driven by regulations. So as the regulations become stricter, these Chinese just say: forget it. My patience is gone,"" he added. In response to CNBC's query, Singapore's MAS said that the money laundering case has not changed its position on regulatory standards. ""Singapore welcomes legitimate wealth. MAS is working with financial institutions in Singapore to improve our practices so that they are sound, effective and efficient,"" said an MAS spokesperson. The fallout from Singapore's money-laundering scandal and high-profile crypto failures like Three Arrows Capital and FTX triggered an aggressive compliance push in 2024, according to Iris Xu, founder of corporate services firm Jenga, whose clients are wealthy mainland Chinese in Singapore. Banks and financial institutions undertook sweeping ""clean-ups"" — redoing know-your-customer (KYC) checks, re-screening family office applications, and in some cases closing accounts altogether. That left many wealthy Chinese clients in limbo, unable to access or open new accounts. ""After the whole year, it destroyed some of the clients' patience and confidence. ""If you don't give them accounts, where are they going to do business?"" Xu said, noting that frustrated clients began moving funds to Japan, Hong Kong and Dubai instead. The barriers go beyond finance. Applicants for permanent residence and family offices must undergo extensive background checks, including disclosures about their family and dependents — requirements they see as invasive, said Lin. ""From their point of view, they're thinking: Do I really need to declare my illegitimate son just because I want to manage wealth in Singapore?"" he told CNBC. Is Singapore losing its wealth hub status? According to Henley & Partners, an advisory firm that helps wealthy clients to obtain residency through investments, Singapore is set to see a sharp slowdown in wealth migration in 2025, with a projected net inflow of 1,600 millionaires — less than half the 3,500 expected in 2024 . Carman Chan, founder of Click Ventures, a single-family office, similarly noted that many of her family office peers who set up businesses in Singapore are relocating back to Hong Kong. Chan, whose single-family office has a presence in both locations, cited challenges like longer KYC screenings and hiring quotas for the wealthy to run a family office in Singapore. Family offices in the city-state that want to qualify for tax exemption schemes must hire a minimum number of investment professionals in Singapore, who must have taxable income in the country. For small outfits, this requirement can feel like a near one-to-one ratio of local to foreign staff, since a two-person office must already include a local hire. ""If they don't have enough locals, that's also a bottleneck because you can't just fly people from outside and relocate them to Singapore,"" Chan said. Coupled with tougher compliance checks, Chan noted that some KYC approvals took over a year, prompting some investors to shift operations elsewhere. Comparatively, it reportedly takes about two to six months in Dubai's International Financial Centre . For Hong Kong, securing residency or a work visa for family office professionals is usually uncomplicated, relative to Singapore, according to advisory firm Acclime . When they lived in Hong Kong before, they might be partying at four or five in the morning with friends. And they like that lifestyle. Partner at Pandan Investments Christopher Aw ""It's a long queue, and that's why some people actually relocate back to Hong Kong,"" she added. This year, Hong Kong rolled out additional measures like tax incentives to attract wealthy individuals and institutions. For one, Hong Kong has lowered the barriers for wealthy people to qualify for residency through investment after revamping its Capital Investment Entrant Scheme earlier this year. Instead of proving they've held 30 million Hong Kong dollars in assets for two years, applicants now only need six months, and they can count family-held wealth or invest via family-owned companies. ""I was quite surprised, because I think a lot of these wealthy Chinese have very short memories. They forgot why they came to Singapore in the first place,"" Bayfront Law's Lin said. Beyond regulations, softer factors like lifestyle differences play a role, especially for the younger rich. ""When they lived in Hong Kong before, they might be partying at four or five in the morning with friends. And they like that lifestyle,"" said Christopher Aw, a partner at Pandan Investments who also noted that several wealthy Chinese peers in Singapore have relocated to Dubai or Hong Kong. Dominic Volek, group head at Henley & Partners, frames the trend as one of rebalancing and hedging jurisdictional exposure. ""Rising regulatory scrutiny, tightening compliance regimes, and social shifts may contribute to their desire for greater privacy and flexibility elsewhere,"" he said. Singapore has been a ""booming"" hub, but now ""it's cooling down, cleaning up,"" Jenga's Xu said. ""The past few years have definitely been a good time for Singapore, and having some corrections now is normal,"" she added.","['Lee Ying Shan', 'In Ying-Shan-Lee']"

Louis Vuitton's long-awaited beauty collection hit branded stores and concessions last month, marking the latest iteration for the 171-year-old LVMH -owned luxury titan.

And while the signature scented lipsticks don't come cheap at $160 a pop, it indicates a wider shift among luxury players trying to get more shoppers through the door without diluting their flagship offerings.

""I think this is a very appropriate move,"" Luca Solca, sector head for global luxury goods at Bernstein, who has extensively studied diversification of luxury brands, told CNBC via email.

""Mega-brands would be wise not to sell too many of their core products and use lower absolute price categories to engage with a broader [range of] aspirational consumers,"" he noted.

With esteemed makeup artist Pat McGrath as creative director, Louis Vuitton may be hoping that the range of 55 lipsticks, 10 lip balms and eight eyeshadow palettes — and an accompanying $2,890 mini trunk carry case — will appeal to her cult following of young, U.S. consumers.

It follows similar expansions into cosmetics by brands such as Prada, LVMH's Celine, Dries Van Noten and, soon, Miu Miu. ""Beauty is an attractive category from a financial viewpoint, as it offers high GM% [gross margins],"" Bernstein said in a note in March.

Meanwhile, the explosive popularity of Labubu keychains has birthed a new wave of extravagant bag charms, including from Coach, Longchamp and a $1,420 option from Louis Vuitton, as brands bet that the ""treatonomics"" trend will tempt shoppers to splurge on little luxuries even as they cut back on bigger ticket items.

The luxury diversification comes as the sector grapples with an industry-wide slowdown, U.S. tariffs, and wider cost pressures.

""Brands are utilizing the playbook from 2015, 2016,"" Jelena Sokolova, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said via email, referring to another period of softness in the industry, amid a dip in Chinese demand.

Italy — a perennial favorite of the rich and famous — is attracting a new wave of ultra-wealthy arrivals looking to take advantage of its investor friendly environment, thriving real estate market and low tax regime. As many other countries clamp down on the super-rich, Italy has been bucking the trend; its accommodative flat-tax regime has enticed hordes of big spenders drawn to luxury living and Milan's increasingly bustling business scene. And despite doubling the one-off charge paid by high-net-worth individuals on their foreign income to 200,000 euros ($233,000) in 2024, this has done little to detract demand for la dolce vita. ""They operate at the wealth level, which is still way above 200,000 per year flat taxation,"" Matteo Pella, senior broker in Berkshire Hathaway HomeService's real estate firm, told CNBC. ""It's like saying: Oh, you're paying for your coffee now. Today it's two euros, tomorrow it's going to be four euros. You're not going to give up on your coffee."" Italy has become a top relocation destination for the wealthy in Europe this year, according to Henley & Partners, which markets citizenship and residency-by-investment schemes. Though the millionaire migration figures have raised some questions, and global wealth flows are notoriously difficult to track, a number of high-profile figures have made the move to Italy over recent months. These include Egypt's richest man and co-owner of Aston Villa Football Club Nassef Sawiris, and the vice-chair of Goldman Sachs, Richard Gnodde. The total number of new high-net-worth arrivals in Italy so far this year could be as high as 3,600, according to Henley & Partners estimates.

Milan's millionaire boom

Italy's flat-tax regime was introduced in 2017 as part of a wider push by the then center-left government to attract foreign investors while encouraging homegrown talent to return to the country following the euro zone debt crisis. That, in turn, has sparked a new wave of businesses looking to cater to the fresh wealth influx, particularly in the country's financial and fashion hub, Milan. Among those are newly opened members club The Wilde and, prior to that, Casa Cipriani.

""We really thought it was a good time to come back to Italy,"" Anna Cipriani, director of membership at Casa Cipriani Milano, told CNBC of the group's 2022 opening. ""Milan has evolved a lot over the years,"" she said. ""Before, it used to be known more for its industrial character and, of course, the fashion houses, while over the last few years it became more and more attractive also for creatives, for investors and for [an] international crowd."" Italy's wealthy arrivals, meanwhile, have led to a surge in real estate prices across some of the country's most desirable locations, from Tuscany and the Italian Riviera to cities such as Rome, Venice and Florence. Milan, and the surrounding lakes region, however, have emerged as a firm favorite. ""We are at all-time high prices at the moment,"" said Pella, who is based in BHHS' Lake Como office. ""In five years, we had an increase [of] double-digit percentages. For the upcoming years, we're probably going to look at a steady 3% to 4% type of increase here in Lake Como.""

Property prices in Milan have risen 49% since the country's flat-tax regime was introduced in 2017, compared to 10.9% across the rest of Italy's big cities, according to real estate group Tecnocasa. Global property consultancy Knight Frank now expects the city's prime real estate market to record a further 3.5% price growth in 2025. ""It's about those who can afford it, because prices are not necessarily down to their street market logic as an investment,"" Pella said. ""They like a property with their guts.

Millionaires have been migrating in droves to new residences, as more and more jurisdictions offer options to those willing to pay. Over the past decade, the number of high-net-worth individuals relocating abroad is estimated to have almost tripled, reaching record highs in 2024. That trend looks set to continue in 2025 and 2026, as a divide deepens between countries seeking to attract the uber-rich and those clamping down in a bid to combat perceived inequality. France has deliberated expanding its wealth tax, while Switzerland is weighing new changes to inheritance tax.

Meanwhile, the U.K. in April abolished its over 200-year-old non-dom tax regime, which exempted wealthy foreigners living in Britain from paying U.K. tax on their overseas income and gains. It follows an outflow of London-based banks and financiers to other European capitals, such as Milan, following the 2016 Brexit vote. That has left other countries looking to fill the gap. ""There are countries literally around the world coming to us and saying: 'We want the U.K.'s millionaires and billionaires. What can we do? How can we bring them to our country?'"" Stuart Wakeling, managing partner at Henley & Partners U.K., said. While such citizenship and residence regimes vary vastly, and can include stringent investment requirements, part of the appeal of Italy's system is its simplicity. The one-off payment offers foreign individuals, or nationals who have lived overseas for at least nine years, exemption from wider taxes on income and assets for up to 15 years.

British luxury fashion house Burberry is set to re-join the U.K.'s FTSE 100 later this month, one year after being relegated from the blue-chip benchmark, index provider FTSE Russell said Wednesday.

The upgrade, part of a quarterly reshuffling at the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), takes place as the heritage brand has been regaining traction under a sweeping overhaul by CEO Joshua Schulman.

Burberry shares were down around 0.8% by 11:33 a.m. London time (6:33 a.m. ET).

The luxury group fell out of the FTSE 100 in September 2024, bringing its 15-year run in the U.K. large-cap index to a close.

It will return to the top 100 index alongside Metlen Energy & Metals , as part of changes set to be implemented at the close of business on Sept. 19 and take effect from the start of trading on Sept. 22.

""Loud luxury"" is poised for a comeback as ailing fashion houses attempt to inject a sense of newness and novelty into their designs to win over weary shoppers. A flurry of new creative directors at brands including Gucci, Chanel and Versace, and the arrival of new Kering CEO Luca de Meo, are seen phasing out ""quiet luxury"" subtlety in favor of statement styles, in what analysts say could be a turning point for the industry. ""We are seeing a shift to a bit more visible luxury at the moment,"" Carole Madjo, head of European luxury goods research at Barclays, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" last month. ""Luxury fashion is a cycle. Now, with quiet luxury being a few years old, you want something else. Back to my novelty, newness thesis: I think this is now the focus."" The sartorial shake-up comes as the luxury sector struggles to overcome a series of headwinds, from trade tariffs to soft consumer sentiment, following its Covid-era boom. Ultra-luxe brands Brunello Cucinelli , Hermes and LVMH 's Loro Piana have navigated that downturn largely unscathed, as their super-rich clientele continued to spend big on understated couture cashmere and high-end handbags.

But for many brands, quiet luxury's discrete opulence, which glided to the fore in 2022 alongside the popularity of shows like HBO's ""Succession,"" no longer cut it. That could herald a new era of large logos, bold branding and distinctive designs dominating catwalks to high streets. ""There is no longer the same level of desire for many products across the market, pushing all major brands to change creative direction in search of relevance,"" Yanmei Tang, analyst at Third Bridge, said via email.

Gucci, Burberry, Moncler

One brand owning that shift is Burberry . Under the leadership of CEO Josh Schulman, the company is once again embracing its British heritage image after years of management changes, declining sales and knock-off dupes sullying associations with its eponymous check print and signature trench. Chief Financial Officer Kate Ferry said during a second-quarter earnings call that the company's statement heritage collection, which includes full checkered two-pieces, was ""reigniting brand desire"" and positioning Burberry among a wide consumer base as ""a luxury brand with broad universal appeal.""

Gucci is seen targeting the same refit under its new artistic director Demna Gvasalia, whose boundary-pushing designs courted controversy at parent company Kering's smaller Balenciaga label. Kering 's deputy CEO and brand development lead, Francesca Bellettini, said last week that a ""first hint of [Demna's] vision for Gucci"" would come in September, with a full rollout of the collection due in early 2026. Fashionistas and investors have long awaited a catalyst to turn around Gucci's fortunes, as sales have suffered, particularly from weaker demand in China. The arrival next month of former Renault chief Luca de Meo as Kering CEO is also set to inject an outsider perspective and branding expertise.

""The key thing is to bring back some brand desirability,"" Madjo said. ""Bringing newness — something fresh which has not been seen before — is, I think, what could make Gucci great again."" New creative and artistic leads are also seen shaking things up at Chanel, Bottega Veneta and the famously out-there Versace. Moncler , meanwhile, has opted to experiment with rotating designers via its Genius collection, and Prada recently cited image adaptability among the brand's virtues. ""What's beautiful about Prada is that it can be sporty, it can be glamorous. This is one of the few brands that can allow us to play three or four games at the same time,"" group CEO Andrea Guerra said on an earnings call last month.

The big divide

Fashion houses will be hoping that the image overhauls can help inspire waning interest from consumers who became disillusioned with brands after significant pandemic-era price hikes failed to reflect product innovation. According to UBS's Evidence Lab, the price of luxury goods rose by a record 8% on average in 2022, well above the pre-Covid rate of 1% and the 3% recorded this year to May. Only top-end brands Hermes, Rolex and Richemont -owned Cartier have been able to sustain significant price rises in 2025 — though many more have warned that tariffs may force their hand. Gucci, Burberry and Prada, meanwhile, have raised prices, but to a smaller extent.

Gucci-owner Kering on Tuesday posted worse-than-feared second-quarter results and flagged ongoing geopolitical uncertainty as woes persist at the beleaguered luxury group.

Sales at the high-end fashion house dropped 15% year-on-year on a comparable basis to 3.7 billion euros ($4.27 billion), compared to the 3.96 billion euros forecast by LSEG analysts.

Gucci sales, which typically make up nearly half of total group revenues, plunged 25% over the quarter to 1.46 billion euros.

Chairman and CEO François-Henri Pinault acknowledged the results as disappointing, but noted ongoing efforts to course correct the struggling luxury giant.

""Though the numbers we are reporting remain well below our potential, we are certain that our comprehensive efforts of the past two years have set healthy foundations for the next stages in Kering's development,"" Pinault said in a statement accompanying the results.

""In an economic and geopolitical environment that remains uncertain, Kering continues to deploy its strategy with the aim of achieving a profitable long-term growth trajectory,"" the company added.

The group, which also owns the Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta brands, said sales were weaker across all markets, led by Japan and the wider Asia Pacific.

Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty Images

High-end spenders are painting a mixed picture when it comes to the luxury market's long-awaited recovery, with softer sales still weighing on company forecasts. But better-than-feared results from bellwether fashion house LVMH moved luxury stocks higher Friday, as investors bet on the emergence of green shoots of recovery. LVMH posted a 4% year-on-year drop in second quarter sales to 19.5 billion euros after the market close Thursday, slightly below a consensus forecast for a 3% decline. ""This was not a stellar quarter for LVMH,"" Deutsche Bank's Adam Cochrane, a luxury equity research analyst, wrote in a Friday note. ""However, we see some glimmers of hope with a sequential improvement in cFX [constant currency] sales expected from 3Q onwards and most of the sales weakness related to weaker tourism."" Here's a look at four key trends to look out for as earnings season rolls on, with fresh numbers due next week from Kering, Hermes and Prada.

Japan weakness

Foreign exchange fluctuations are a perennial concern for luxury firms, but that's even more the case this quarter as they face high comparable sales from last year. A sharp decline in the Japanese yen sparked a surge in tourist flows and luxury shopping in the country in 2024. But now brands are battling a rebalancing. Richemont saw sales in Japan drop 15% year-on-year in the three months to June, following a 59% jump over the same period the year prior. Burberry also cited a ""challenging performance"" in Japan in the second quarter, and Moncler said Japan was its only negative-performing Asia market — both without providing specific figures. Some firms noted, however, that a downturn in tourism to Japan — and to a lesser extent Europe — has resulted in an uptick in domestic spending in certain other markets. ""[In China] we have seen tangible improvement locally,"" said LVMH's Chief Financial Officer Cécile Cabanis during an earnings call Thursday, citing a ""repatriation from the big drop we've seen in tourism to Japan.""

U.S. sales spike

Several luxury firms have also pointed to a strengthening of U.S. sales in the second quarter, even as consumers wait with bated breath for the impact of tariffs. Burberry , Richemont, Moncler and Brunello Cucinelli all reported increased sales in their American markets over the second quarter, while LVMH noted that American demand was ""broadly unchanged."" Still, the extent to which that uptick is driven by U.S. customers frontloading purchases ahead of the full onset of tariffs is not yet clear, according to the firms.

watch now

""To tell you that this was driven by an anticipation of buying links to the tariffs? Honestly, I cannot tell you,"" Roberto Eggs, Moncler's chief business strategy and global market officer, said on an earnings call Wednesday. Luxury companies have also been honing in on the U.S. market in recent quarters in a bid to compensate for continued soft demand in the key Chinese market. Burberry CEO Joshua Schulman said the company's recent U.S. growth indicated the ""diversity of the luxury consumer that exists in that market,"" from elite, high-spenders to high-traffic mall shoppers.

Price increases

U.S. tariffs are nonetheless weighing on the outlook for most European luxury houses, who rely heavily on localized production as part of their cache. As such, many have suggested that they will need to raise prices in the coming quarters to offset added costs. Brunello Cucinelli flagged price hikes of 3% to 4% in the U.S. while Moncler said it was implementing ""mid-single-digit"" percentage increases for the coming 12 months. Burberry, meanwhile, said it began adjusting prices last year as part of broader overhaul plans.

LVMH, on the other hand, said Thursday that prices rises would need to come with an ""improvement in the product"" or modest rebalancing around inflation. However, the French luxury conglomerate then went on to cite price hikes among ""several levers"" at its disposal to counter the impact of tariffs. It comes as the cost of luxury goods has risen by an average of 3% so far this year — the slowest pace since 2019 — according to UBS' evidence lab, as brands have sought to reconcile consumer retention with higher input costs following a Covid-era surge in prices.

2025-07-24 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,"Moncler raises prices on tariffs, may postpone store openings if downturn worsens","Italian luxury house Moncler said it's currently relying on ""very slight price increases"" to offset the initial impact of U.S. tariffs, but warned that broader economic weakness could cause it to delay its new store openings next year.

The Milan-headquartered retailer said Wednesday that it had raised prices by ""mid-single-digit"" percentages for the second half of 2025 and will raise them for the first half of next year, while adding that it was awaiting further clarity on U.S. levies before setting out its full strategy for 2026.

""We normally finalize our pricing strategy for the full Winter 2026 by October, more or less. So it's still early,"" Luciano Santel, group chief corporate and supply officer, said during an earnings call accompanying its second-quarter results.

Shares of Moncler were down 4% by 2 p.m. London time (9 a.m. E.T.).

Chief Business Strategy and Global Market Officer Roberto Eggs said he intended for those further price rises to be ""more conservative,"" as the firm seeks to reconcile higher input costs with customer retention, but noted that it was also dependent on macro trends and currency movements.

""Clearly, the pricing today for consumers is a concern. I think we need to pay even more attention on this,"" he said.

Eggs also noted that the business would remain flexible on its plans for a dozen or so new store openings etched for 2026, based on the macro outlook and wider recovery of the beleaguered luxury sector.

""For the plan 2025, it's already there. Regarding 2026, the plan is not completely finalized, so we have some flexibility, ... in case things will not get better, to postpone some of the openings,"" he said, adding that those plans would also be set by October.

Moncler on Wednesday posted a dip in second-quarter sales after the market close, as weak tourist flows weighed on otherwise robust domestic demand in the key U.S. and China markets.

Group revenues fell 1% year-on-year at constant exchange rates to 396.6 million euros ($536.7 million) in the three months to June 30, below the 427.2 million forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll.

The U.S., which accounts for 14% of Moncler brand sales, recorded a 5% sales uptick in the quarter, but the company said it was unclear whether that was driven by shoppers accelerating purchases ahead of the ramping up of tariffs.

""To tell you that if this was driven by an anticipation of buying links to the tariffs? Honestly, I cannot tell you,"" Eggs said, noting other initiatives, such as a partnership with luxury department store Nordstom, which helped boost demand.

Sales in Asia, the group's largest market, were flat on the quarter, while in Europe, the Middle East and Africa they declined 8%. The company attributed it to a rebalancing of the Japanese yen, with Japan the only Asian country to record negative sales growth, as well as soft tourist spending in Europe.",['Karen Gilchrist']

American shoppers are buying into the allure of British heritage fashion, providing a glimmer of hope for beleaguered Burberry 's turnaround even as U.S. headwinds loom.

Burberry sales in the Americas rose 4% year-on-year in the three months to June 28, the company said Friday in its fiscal first-quarter results.

Shares of Burberry were up 8.13% by 11:26 a.m. London time (6:26 a.m. E.T.).

The luxury brand, known for its trench coats, attributed the uptick to both new and existing consumers, following a 4% decline in the region in the fourth-quarter and a 9% fall in Burberry's full 2025 fiscal year.

CEO Joshua Schulman said the growth indicated the ""diversity of the luxury consumer that exists in that market,"" from elite, high-spenders to high-traffic mall shoppers. The U.S. accounts for 19% of Burberry's business.

Nevertheless, Schulman said that Burberry's efforts to position itself as a ""luxury brand with broad universal appeal"" was showing green shoots in other regions, too.

Burberry's overall group revenues declined 1% year-on-year on a comparable basis to £433 million ($ 582million) in the June quarter, compared with the 3% decline analysts had forecast in a company compiled consensus.

Sales rose 1% in Europe, the Middle East, India, and Africa (EMEIA) in the June quarter, while declining 5% in the Greater China region and by 4% in Asia Pacific, which the company said was ""driven by Japan following a slowdown in tourism.""

All regions nevertheless demonstrated notable improvements from significant declines in prior quarters.

A currency-fueled spending splurge in the key Japanese luxury market has finally abated, weighing on sales at Cartier-owner Richemont.

The Swiss luxury group's Japan sales declined 15% year-on-year at constant exchange rates in the fiscal first quarter, it said Wednesday in its fiscal first-quarter sales report.

Revenues at the Swiss luxury group nevertheless rose 6% year-on-year at constant exchange rates to 5.41 billion euros ($6.28 billion) in the three months to the end of June, slightly ahead of the 5.37 billion euros forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll.

Shares of the firm closed up 1.2%.

The decline in Japan sales follows a 59% jump in revenues in the same quarter last year, as a weaker yen sparked a surge in international tourism and luxury spend.

The Japanese yen began steadily depreciating last year after the Bank of Japan brought an end to negative interest rates and terminated its yield curve control policy in March. In June of that year, the Japanese currency weakened to 38-year lows, crossing the 161 mark against the dollar.

Richemont, whose brands also include Van Cleef & Arpels and Buccellati, benefitted from that weakness throughout last year, reporting 20% to 25% sales growth in Japan over consecutive quarters.

It was not alone. Other major luxury groups LVMH, Kering and Burberry all noted the uptick, led in particular by Chinese shoppers flocking to the East Asian country.

The fourth-quarter sales bump was led by double-digit growth at the group's Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and Buccellati.

Full-year sales rose 4% to 21.4 billion euros, up on the previous year and just ahead of analyst expectations of 21.34 billion euros.

Sales rose annually across all regions, except Asia Pacific (ex. Japan) — the company's largest market — where declines were led by a 23% drop in China. Japan led annual sales growth, up 25% at actual exchange rates, buoyed by ""strong domestic and tourist spend"" and a weak Japanese Yen.

Burberry on Wednesday announced a slew of organizational changes, amid continued turnaround efforts at the embattled luxury house.

The company said the measures could lead to a ""reduction in people-related costs which could impact around 1,700 roles globally"" over the lifetime of the program, set to complete in 2027.

The moves — which include cost cutting across procurement and real estate — are estimated to lead to cost savings of £60 million ($79.9 million) and mark the latest phase of CEO Joshua Schulman's strategy to improve revive the fortunes of the heritage British brand. It follows £40 million in cost cutting measures announced in November, taking totaled estimated cost savings to £100 million.

The job cuts will impact around 20% of Burberry's overall headcount, with the majority set to take place in office-based roles, as well as within stores and at its factory in Castleford, England.

Burberry shares ended the day 17% higher.

Burberry sales fell slightly less than expected in the fiscal fourth quarter, down 6% in the three months to March. Analysts had anticipated a 7% decline in a company-compiled consensus estimate.

For the fiscal year, sales were down 12% versus an anticipated 13% decline. Total revenue for the year was £2.461 billion ($3.273 billion), slightly ahead of an estimated £2.451 billion.

Sales fell across all regions over the year and the quarter, led by weakness in Asia-Pacific. Sales in the Americas — which had been a bright spot of positive performance in the third quarter — swung to a 4% loss in the three months to end the fiscal year.

Burberry had previously flagged the U.S. as a bright spot in third-quarter sales. However, the fashion house said Wednesday that ""current macroeconomic environment has become more uncertain in light of geopolitical developments.""

""While we are operating against a difficult macroeconomic backdrop and are still in the early stages of our turnaround, I am more optimistic than ever that Burberry's best days are ahead and that we will deliver sustainable profitable growth over time,"" Schulman said in a statement.

The company did not provide specific guidance on the estimated impact of U.S. tariffs. It neverthless flagged an ""increase in geopolitical tension which leads to incremental unmitigated tariff risks compared to the central planning scenario"" as a key downside risk.

Burberry Chief Financial Officer Kate Ferry said the tariff impact was currently ""very dynamic"" and that the company would not be drawn on exact figures.

""We are a well diversified business. The U.S. is really important but it is 19% of our business. Wherever tariffs end up, we'll be able to respond,"" Ferry said during an earnings call on Wednesday.

Schulman in November announced urgent plans to ""course correct"" after a prolonged period of underperformance for the company amid waning sales and a slew of management changes.

The strategic overhaul marks the latest iteration of the 169-year-old retailer. Schulman joined in July from Michael Kors, becoming the brand's fourth CEO in the last decade.

Analysts nevertheless questioned the pace of Schulman's agenda and suggested that it could be some time yet before it bears fruit.

""At a time of extreme market gyrations BRBY's [Burberry's] finals suggest the brand's turn-around case is in slow-burn mode,"" Jefferies wrote in a note.

They also noted the limitations of Burberry's refocusing on timeless, staple pieces, such as its signature trench, and the ability of Chief Creative Officer Daniel Lee to innovate in that space.

According to the North America Family Office Report by RBC and Campden Wealth released last September, a significant number of family offices reported how hiring was a ""big challenge"" and expressed difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff. The same is true for European family offices. Meanwhile, family offices in growing Asian wealth hubs such as Singapore are turning to automating workflows and outsourcing due to talent shortages in the city-state. Family offices also have to compete with banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent. The talent crunch, though, is not just owed to a lack of qualified candidates — it's also selectivity on the part of family offices.

Trust issues

While potential candidates find it difficult to step into the family office bandwagon, some family offices can also be particular when it comes to choosing the perfect fit. The key criteria: Trust. ""Why did the boss give the accountant the money? Because they have a lifelong relationship,"" said Tobias Prestel, managing director of Prestel and Partner Family Office Conferences. ""In the family office space, very often not the best person for the job gets the job but the one who's trusted,"" he told CNBC. ""If you have $500 million, who do you trust? Who do you give the key to everything to? It's not an easy decision,"" said Prestel, who organizes private discussion and investment forums for family offices around the world.

If you have $500 million, who do you trust? Who do you give the key to everything to? It's not an easy decision. Tobias Prestel Prestel and Partner Family Office Conferences

Some families have the tendency to put a huge emphasis on the trust factor over other criteria, said Reto Jauch, partner at SZ&J. While this can be a good thing, sometimes it can be detrimental to the job, he added. Family offices are often looking to combine roles such as a chief investment officer cum CFO, where they hope to find the ideal right hand man, said Iris Xu, founder of accounting and corporate services firm Jenga, which hires full-time and contracted professionals for family offices in Singapore. ""That's a very tall order. Or very few professionals are both willing and capable to cover all these areas,"" she said. The wealthy are however stepping up their game to pursue the talent they want. And sometimes, this means being willing to pay a ""trust delta,"" or salary premium, especially if the family wants someone to work for them, said Jauch, particularly in a climate where family offices are willing to pay up to $190,000 a year for executive assistants. European family offices are raising compensation packages to retain and attract talent by offering bonuses and other incentives like co-investment opportunities and a share in investment management profits, a separate report by Campden Wealth and HSBC showed.

'Risky' affair

Young employees are reluctant to work at family offices for reasons including the lack of a clear corporate structure, as well as how it is widely perceived as a ""retirement job,"" experts in the industry told CNBC. Family offices can appear ""risky"" to potential employees given their relatively informal structure, unclear reporting lines and undefined career progression, said Jenga's Xu. Xu added that investment-related roles in family offices tend to be harder to fill compared to other roles, with the turnover rate largely between one and two years. ""In the corporate world, at the end of the day, everything is fungible, including the CEO,"" said SZ&J's Jauch.

2025-05-10 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/investing/,A rare platinum Rolex is heading to auction and could fetch $1.7 million,"A rare 1999 platinum Rolex Daytona featuring a mother-of-pearl dial with diamond hour markers — one of only four known to exist.

A legendary timepiece is about to step into the spotlight.

A 1999 platinum Rolex Daytona is heading to auction on Sunday at Sotheby's Geneva, and could sell for up to $1.7 million.

The watch is made from platinum, a material Rolex did not use on Daytona models until 2013. Its face is mother-of-pearl, set with 10 diamonds. Unlike nearly every other Rolex on the market, it was not part of a standard collection. It was privately commissioned, custom-made for a client — something almost unheard of for Rolex.

""It's very unusual to come across a commission,"" said Pedro Reiser, senior watch specialist at Sotheby's. ""There are other brands which might be more flexible and do these kinds of exercises, maybe on a regular basis — but not in the space of Rolex pieces where you barely can come across any commission whatsoever.""

Only four of these watches are known to exist, made for the same family, each with a different dial. The watch heading to the auction block is the last one to be sold. The others have already gone for massive prices, topping $3 million.

There is big hype around this small work of metal. It is believed to have been created under the leadership of Patrick Heiniger, Rolex's CEO from 1992 to 2008. He ran the company during a time of major growth and secrecy and helped turn Rolex from a respected watch brand into a global luxury icon.",['Christopher Dilella']

Revenues at the fashion giant plunged 14% year-on-year in the first quarter to 3.9 billion euros ($4.4 billion), according to its Wednesday report, below the 4.01 billion euros forecast by LSEG analysts.

Gucci sales, which make up nearly half of total group revenues, fell 25% on a comparable basis to 1.57 billion euros, as an attempted turnaround of the brand remains underway.

Kering shares were down 4.3% by 10:00 a.m. London time, after trading of the stock was initially halted at the market open. Shares of other luxury groups Richemont , LVMH and Hermes also traded lower.

The company's overall weakness was led by a 25% decline in group sales in Asia, as well as a 13% dip in both North America and Europe.

Kering Chairman and CEO François-Henri Pinault said the company had faced a ""difficult start to the year"" and highlighted further challenges ahead for the beleaguered luxury sector.

""In this environment, we are fully focused on executing on our action plans to reach our strategic and financial objectives and strengthen the positioning of our Houses on all our markets,"" he said in a statement.

""We are increasing our vigilance to weather the macroeconomic headwinds our industry faces, and I am convinced that we will come out stronger from the present situation,"" he added.

Kering last month named Demna Gvasalia as Gucci's new artistic director, in its latest bid to turn around its ailing main label. The stock took a beating on the appointment, however, as investors fretted over controversy surrounding Gvasalia's earlier work on a 2022 ad campaign at smaller Kering label Balenciaga label.

Gucci has suffered several consecutive quarters of weak sales as its designs have fallen out of favor with shoppers and its high exposure to the Chinese consumer has seen it hard hit by a recent downturn in the once lucrative Asian market.

It comes amid a wider downturn in the luxury market over recent years amid higher inflation and weaker economic conditions.

That landscape appeared to be shifting at the turn of the year, with a slew high-end fashion houses reporting more upbeat fourth-quarter earnings. Nevertheless, analysts have previously warned that a tariff-induced macroeconomic slowdown could hinder that recovery going forward.

""Weaker global stock markets and the broader economic uncertainty will weigh on confidence and we see this further postponing a recovery in luxury demand,"" Adam Cochrane, general retail and luxury equity research analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote earlier this month.

Luxury brands had been expected to be more sheltered than other retailers from the immediate impact of tariffs, with high-end labels typically better able to pass on added costs to wealthy consumers. However, analysts noted that brands with already weak sales, including Kering, may be less placed to do so.

""We also note the brands may be slower to increase prices due to tariffs given weakening customer sentiment and general price elasticity, which is a key difference between Kering and LVMH (LVMH previously mentioned pricing as a main lever),"" TD Cowen wrote in a note Thursday.",['Karen Gilchrist']

There's real momentum."" Rendering provided by Sotheby's International Realty

As the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged and tariff headlines rippled through global markets, a different number was turning heads in Manhattan: A newly listed $110 million penthouse, now the most expensive home for sale in New York City. The listing debuted April 3 during one of Wall Street's most turbulent weeks on record. That day, the Dow fell 1,679 points, shedding 4%. The day after, it lost another a 2,231 points. Markets have been turbulent ever since as trade policy uncertainty leaves investors uneasy. Sotheby's International Realty broker Nikki Field, who represents the Manhattan listing, said the market swings haven't rattled her target buyers. ""This buyer segment remains untouched by market volatility,"" Field said. ""They're not reacting to headlines or fluctuations. They're focused on curating world-class portfolios, and ultra-prime residential real estate continues to be a core asset class for them."" The property in question is a rare bundled offering atop the landmark Steinway Tower at 111 West 57th St. Penthouse 80 and Penthouse 82 are being marketed together as a potential quadplex, spanning the tower's top four levels, which feature private elevator access. Combined, they offer 11,480 square feet, five bedrooms, six bathrooms, multiple lounges, and a 618-square-foot terrace with sweeping views of Central Park and both rivers on either side of Manhattan.

Altogether, the combined square footage totals 11,480 square feet, with five bedrooms, six bathrooms, multiple lounges, and a 618-square-foot terrace offering panoramic views of Central Park and both rivers. Rendering provided by Sotheby's International Realty

""While the homes remain physically separate today, the opportunity lies in their architectural potential,"" Field said. According to Sotheby's, neither unit has ever been publicly listed or marketed individually.

Though currently uncombined, the two mega-residences are being marketed as a potential quadplex spanning the tower's top four levels. Rendering provided by Sotheby's International Realty

Since launching the quadplex listing earlier this month, Field says buyer interest has been strong. ""Several highly qualified individuals have already inquired and toured the residence. There's real momentum,"" she said. According to reporting from The Real Deal, Field and her team took over sales at 111 West 57th St. in July, replacing Corcoran Group and becoming the third brokerage since the building launched in 2018.

Penthouse premium

Jonathan Miller of real estate appraisal and consulting firm Miller Samuel told CNBC that while nine-figure listings were once seen as more publicity stunt than actual sale, that dynamic has changed. ""U.S. home sales over $100 million now average about four per year,"" he said. ""We saw a record nine in 2021 and eight in 2024."" Last year, New York saw just two nine-figure listings: a $135 million penthouse at the Crown Building purchased by billionaire Vladislav Doronin, and a $115 million sale at the Central Park Tower acquired by Extell founder Gary Barnett. One of the more notable examples sits just down the block: Ken Griffin's 2019 purchase of a 24,000-square-foot quadplex at 220 Central Park South, which still holds the record for the most expensive home ever sold in the U.S. at $238 million.

For context, Griffin's acquisition totaled approximately $10,420 per square foot. The $110 million listing at 111 West 57th St., at 11,480 square feet, comes in at roughly $9,578 per square foot. Still, Miller cautioned against reading too much into these sky-high sales: ""They should be viewed as one-off sales and not attached to local luxury housing markets.""

Shifts in the high-end market

While Field remains bullish on ultra-prime demand, some brokers in the broader luxury market are seeing more hesitation. A recent Wall Street Journal report found that more luxury buyers are backing out of deals due to the instability. ""The lack of a clear strategy on tariffs has created economic uncertainty,"" Miller said. ""And that's expected to slow housing activity."" According to Realtor.com's 2025 High-End Housing Market Trends and Outlook report, the wealthiest 10% of Americans hold most of their assets in the stock market, about 36.3% in corporate stocks and mutual funds. Real estate made up 18.7% of their total wealth. ""No one likes uncertainty ... that's the worst thing for real estate. And right now, no one really knows what's next,"" said Douglas Elliman New York City luxury broker Noble Black. ""Some clients believe tariffs could lead to inflation and ultimately higher property values. Others are using this as a chance to move out of financial markets and into real estate."" Still, there are signs of resilience at the high end. According to the Olshan Luxury Market Report, which tracks Manhattan contracts for homes priced at $4 million and above, 33 contracts were signed between April 14 and April 20, that's up from 29 such contracts the previous week. ""It was a surprisingly strong showing for the luxury market,"" Donna Olshan noted in the report, especially given the holiday calendar and market volatility.

Shares of LVMH plunged 7.8% on Tuesday, losing its position as the world's largest luxury firm to rival Hermès after an unexpected decline in first-quarter sales. LVMH reported a 3% year-on-year fall in first-quarter sales in a trading update published shortly after the market close on Monday, missing consensus analyst expectations for slight growth. The results pulled down the wider sector in morning deals amid broader market gains. Kering shares declined 5.2%, Burberry fell 4.6% while Richemont traded 0.9% lower. LVMH shares on course for the worst session since March 2020. A 0.2% increase in the share price of Hermès saw the Birkin bag-maker's market capitalization surpass that of LVMH. The afternoon moves put LVMH's market capitalization at 244.1 billion euros ($275.4 billion) against Hermès' 246.4 billion euros, according to a CNBC calculation of FactSet data.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon LVMH share price.

LVMH spent several years as Europe's most valuable company starting with 2021, as luxury stocks were buoyed by hopes of a post-Covid-19 pandemic boom. It has lost more 45% of its value since its record close in 2023. It was overtaken by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk in late 2023 — before the maker of weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy was itself usurped by German software firm SAP in March 2025.

First-quarter drop

LVMH's wines and spirits saw the sharpest revenue decline in the first quarter, down 9%, as it flagged weaker demand in the U.S. and China for cognac — the popular brandy variety that has been caught up in geopolitical tensions. The key fashion and leather goods division, which accounted for 78% of profit in 2024, slid 5%. Sales of watches were flat. Europe was the only region to record growth, up 2% on an organic basis. Asia excluding Japan plunged 11%, U.S. sales were 3% lower, while Japan was down 1%. Citi analysts Thomas Chauvet and Mahesh Mohankumar said in a Monday evening note that there was ""not much to cheer for at the luxury bellwether,"" with sales ""overall below the most conservative buyside expectations."" They added that it was difficult to foresee sequential revenue improvement in the second and third quarters for either LVMH or the luxury sector while U.S. and global economic uncertainty remained elevated. ""Whilst structural growth drivers remain in place, shorter term visibility is very limited, especially in light of trade tension and tariffs... The next positive catalyst for LVMH/the sector would likely need to come from a macro surprise, as fundamentals will likely remain tough in the short term,"" Bank of America Global Research analysts said in a note.

Tariff impact

The luxury sector, reliant on global supply chains and U.S. consumer demand, is facing a host of headwinds from U.S. President Donald Trump's volatile trade policy. LVMH, which owns brands including Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon and Hennessy, is the first major European luxury firm to report first-quarter earnings since Trump announced — and then delayed — reciprocal tariffs on its global trading partners. As such, investors are eager for an indication of the firms' forward guidance on the potential impact of tariffs on input costs and consumer demand. LVMH Chief Financial Officer Cecile Cabanis told analysts in a Monday call that the group had not seen a ""major change in trend"" in the first quarter and that it continued to see solid growth in the past six months. ""It's true that aspirational clientele is always more vulnerable in less positive economic cycles and uncertainties, and it might have had some impact in the recent weeks, but rather on categories like wines and spirits and beauty,"" Cabanis said, according to a FactSet transcript. Cabanis declined to comment specifically on pricing in the second quarter, but said that it would consider using repricing of goods as a level to moderately offset inflation or swings in currencies. Luxury brands are expected to be more sheltered than other retailers from the immediate impact of tariffs, with high-end labels typically better able to pass on added costs to wealthy consumers. Still, analysts have warned that the potential for a tariff-induced economic downturn could weigh heavily on demand —particularly in the key U.S. and China markets — further delaying the sector's recovery from a period of prolonged weakness.","['Jenni Reid Karen Gilchrist', 'Jenni Reid', 'Karen Gilchrist']"

Shares of European luxury stocks LVMH , Richemont , Kering and Hermes were among those to slip lower Wednesday as levies on U.S. imports from the European Union took hold. The outlook remains unclear, even as President Trump later announced a 90 day pause and reduced rates to 10% universal tariffs.

High-end fashion houses — for whom the made-in-Europe label is part of the allure — are less likely than other firms to bow to President Donald Trump's ultimate demand to relocate manufacturing to the U.S., instead indicating that they will pass on increased import costs to consumers.

Yet a broader slump in the global economy could make those hikes tougher to bear, even for wealthy shoppers, who are typically better able to absorb price shocks, analysts have warned.

Odds of a U.S. and global recession this year climbed to 60% following Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement, according to JPMorgan, with CEO Jamie Dimon saying Wednesday that the resultant market turmoil had made a recession ""likely.""

""Weaker global stock markets and the broader economic uncertainty will weigh on confidence and we see this further postponing a recovery in luxury demand,"" Adam Cochrane, general retail and luxury equity research analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note Wednesday.

Luca Solca, senior analyst for global luxury goods at Bernstein, echoed that sentiment, dubbing the first round effect of U.S. tariffs as ""negligible"" but citing notable knock-on effects.

""What we should worry about, in case, are the second and third level impacts of the new American policies, if they precipitate a sharp global recession and stock market correction,"" Solca wrote in a note last week.

European luxury companies broadly generate a relatively minimal 15% to 30% of sales from the Americas as a whole, according to Bernstein estimates. Nevertheless, the U.S. market has become an important growth driver in recent quarters as firms have shifted their focus amid waning China sales. Meanwhile, already subdued Chinese demand could be further hit by 125% U.S. tariffs, effective Wednesday.",['Karen Gilchrist']

Ferrari said Thursday it will raise prices by 10% on certain models after April 1 in response to new U.S. auto tariffs, adding up to $50,000 to the price of a typical Ferrari.

The Maranello, Italy-based sports car maker said prices will remain unchanged for all cars imported before April 2. After that, the ""commercial terms"" for three of its model families — the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma — will ""remain unchanged,"" the company said in a release.

Yet, its more popular models, including the Purosangue SUV, the 12Cilindri and the F80, will get price increases of up to 10%.

For the Purosangue, which starts at about $430,000, that price hike amounts to about $43,000. For the limited edition F80, which starts at more than $3.5 million, the increase will add more than $350,000 to the price tag.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced tariffs of 25% on all cars not made in the U.S. Ferrari produces all of its cars at its Maranello factory.

Last year, Ferrari produced 13,752 cars. The company plans to launch its first all-electric Ferrari in October.

It is unclear what effect the tariffs will have on Ferrari sales, since there is already a waiting list of more than a year for most of its vehicles. Ferrari buyers are generally wealthy enough to easily absorb the price hikes.

Ferrari also said Thursday it ""confirms its financial targets for 2025"" but added that there is a ""potential risk of 50 basis points on profitability percentage margins.""

In an interview with CNBC this month, Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said even though Ferrari buyers are wealthy, the company has to be sensitive to passing on too much of the added cost of tariffs.

""When we look at the client, we consider that these people to buy a Ferrari, they have to work,"" he said. ""We have to respect them. Because for us, the most important thing is the client. So we need to make sure that we treat them in the right way.""

Shares of Kering plunged on Friday after the company announced that Demna Gvasalia would take the reins as new artistic director of its ailing Gucci fashion line.

Gvasalia, known as Demna in the industry, joins internally from Kering-owned Balenciaga. He replaces Sabato De Sarno, whose departure was announced last month.

Shares closed down 10.7%, paring earlier losses of 12.4% — the stock's biggest decline since October 2008, according to Reuters.

""Demna's contribution to the industry, to Balenciaga, and to the Group's success has been tremendous. His creative power is exactly what Gucci needs,"" Kering's chairman and CEO François-Henri Pinault said in a statement.

Demna, a Georgian national and Gucci's first non-Italian artistic director since Tom Ford, served for almost a decade at Kering's smaller label Balenciaga. He is known for bringing streetwear into the luxury sphere.

He courted controversy in 2022 following an ad campaign featuring children with bondage-style products. One ad involved a child holding a handbag in the form of a stuffed teddy bear in bondage-style straps, while another featured papers including text from a 2008 Supreme Court ruling relating to child pornography.

The appointment marks Kering's latest bid to turn around its main Gucci label, which accounts for around half of total group revenues but has suffered waning sales amid weaker demand from the key Chinese market.

Gucci sales plunged 24% annually in the fourth quarter to 1.92 billion euros, Kering reported last month, amid a broader 12% fall in group revenues.

Kering confirmed that Demna's appointment will take effect from July 2025.

Speculation had been mounting that Kering may seek an external appointment to revive Gucci's fortunes after its years of maximalist style fell out of vogue amid an industry-wide shift toward ""quiet luxury.""

Writing in a note Thursday, Jefferies analysts said that the company would now need to ""move at pace"" to reinvigorate the fashion appeal of Gucci.

Europe's troubled luxury sector is showing signs of revival after an upbeat earnings season. But continued weakness in China — and the prospect of U.S. tariffs — could leave even the most exclusive brands vying for share of pocket. ""2024 has been one of the worst years for the sector. We believe there will be a sort of normalization going through 2025, particularly in the second half,"" Simone Ragazzi, portfolio manager at Algebris Investments, told CNBC via video call last week. Birkin bag maker Hermes posted blowout fourth-quarter sales earlier this month, extending its outperformance at the close of a broadly upbeat earnings season, during which even embattled fashion houses LVMH and Gucci-owner Kering beat quarterly forecasts. The results added weight to earlier forecasts of a long-awaited turnaround for the sector, after Cartier-owner Richemont last month posted its ""highest ever"" quarterly sales in the three month to December. ""The conclusion seems to be the worst is behind us – that was most likely the third quarter of 2024 – and we're seeing a cyclical recovery in progress, driven by the U.S. consumers and European consumers, for the most part,"" Luca Solca, senior analyst for global luxury goods at Bernstein, said via email.

U.S. tariff threats loom

Nevertheless, question marks remain around the recovery of Chinese consumption — a longtime pillar of the luxury market — and the prospect of U.S. tariffs hampering the sector and beyond. Still weak China sales remained a recurring theme of fourth-quarter reports, with L'Oreal and Kering's Gucci — two groups especially exposed to the market — highlighting declining sales in the country. Meanwhile, possible levies on European companies under U.S. President Donald Trump, coupled with broader macroeconomic uncertainty, were key features of earnings calls. Zuzanna Pusz, head of European luxury goods at UBS, told CNBC that should extra duties be imposed, firms would likely look to pass those onto consumers via price hikes — something both Kering and Hermes signaled earlier this month that they may do. However, she noted that some companies would have a tougher time justifying additional price rises than others. ""We're already coming off of heavy price increases. If firms were to have 25% tariffs, it will be hard to offset these,"" Ragazzi agreed, noting that it could be ""very painful"" for some firms.

watch now

Europe's luxury sector is unusual in that most of its operations cannot be replicated in overseas markets like the U.S. — a key intention of Trump's import charges. Bestowing a ""Made in Italy"" label on a leather jacket, for instance, is contingent on the product being produced there. That suggests that luxury firms could be exempt from the most punitive of measures, Pusz said. However, to the extent that trade levies hurt targeted economies, such as China's — by increasing overall prices and hampering consumer sentiment — that could be a concern for the sector. ""Anything that would negatively impact the economy in China would be a risk,"" Pusz said via video call earlier this month.

Divergence between the best and the rest

That, in turn, could worsen the existing divergence between the luxury market's best and worst performing firms, analysts agreed. ""Whether tariffs or any other shocks, when a consumer has to buy less, they become even more selective, and they will take even more to the brands they like,"" Pusz said. Carole Madjo, head of European luxury goods research at Barclays, noted that some luxury brands had been punished lately for a ""lack of innovation [and] high pricing,"" and would be further obliged to justify their prices.

Haute couture fashion house Hermes on Friday reported a better-than-expected jump in fourth-quarter sales, proving still strong demand for the most exclusive products in an otherwise turbulent luxury market.

The maker of the Birkin handbag posted a 17.6% year-on-year rise in revenues at constant exchange rates to 3.96 billion euros ($4.15 billion) in the three months to Dec. 31, outpacing the 3.69 billion euros forecast by LSEG analysts.

Full-year sales hiked by an annual 14.7% at constant exchange rates to 15.2 billion euros versus an anticipated 14.94 billion euros.

Company shares were up 4% during the day before paring gains to close 0.8% higher.

Hermes has largely evaded a wider luxury sector downturn over recent years, maintaining a sense of allure and exclusivity where other brands have faced pushback amid higher costs and limited innovation.

Executive Chairman Axel Dumas pointed to the loyalty of customers in maintaining sales growth in an otherwise volatile macroeconomic environment.

""In 2024, in a more uncertain economic and geopolitical context, the solid performance of the results attests to the strength of the Hermès model and the agility of the house's teams, whom I thank warmly,"" Dumas said in a statement accompanying the results.

Looking ahead, the French fashion house forecast continued revenue growth in 2025 without providing a specific figure, and said that it was moving into the year ""with confidence."" Dumas added, however, in an earnings call that it was ""too early to see an inflection"" point in the wider industry, according to Reuters.

Sales growth was broad-based across all regions, with Asia-Pacific excluding Japan recording what the company dubbed a ""remarkable"" 9% year-on-year increase in the fourth quarter despite wider weakness in the key Chinese luxury market.

Sales at Gucci, which account for almost half of the group's total revenues, plunged 24% annually over the three month period to 1.92 billion euros, on a comparable basis, extending losses for the group's once darling luxury label.

Operating income for the year totaled 2.55 billion euros, in line with the group's revised forecast as of October but almost half of the 4.75 billion result achieved the year prior. Kering shares popped 6% in opening trade Tuesday, before paring gains to trade up 0.5% by 10:15 a.m. London time. ""In a difficult year, we accelerated the transformation of several of our Houses and moved determinedly to strengthen the health and desirability of our brands for the long term,"" chairman and CEO François-Henri Pinault said in a statement. ""Our efforts must remain sustained and we are confident that we have driven Kering to a point of stabilization, from which we will gradually resume our growth trajectory."" The French fashion house pointed to a slight improvement in Asia Pacific and North America sales across its Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta brands, but did not provide details on specific markets.

Kering is the latest European luxury group to report earnings over recent weeks, as investors look for signs of a revival in a sector hampered by a downturn in consumer spending, particularly in the key Chinese market. Last month, investors were underwhelmed by only slightly better-than-expected full-year results from luxury bellwether LVMH. The market had put faith in a sector-wide turnaround after stellar results from Cartier owner Richemont, but sustained weakness in LVMH's fashion and leather goods and wines and spirits segments pointed to further divergence in the sector. Kering, which is especially exposed to the Chinese consumer, has been battling a particularly acute downturn, as its star label Gucci has fallen out of vogue. On Thursday, the fashion group announced the departure of Gucci design chief Sabato De Sarno, in the first major change since Gucci CEO Stefano Cantino joined last year to revive the brand. Minimalist designer De Sarno was in situ for less than two years, after replacing Alessandro Michele, whose maximalist designs defined the brand over previous years. De Sarno's replacement will be announced ""in due time,"" the company said in a statement. Simone Ragazzi, senior equity analyst at Algebris Investments, on Monday said that Kering would be hoping to signal a reset for the brand with the new design appointment, but added that investors were likely to remain cautious as legacy issues remain.
